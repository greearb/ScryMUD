<help general color>

This command allows you to view and change your color settings.  It
does not enable/disable the use of ANSI color however:  That is
done through the toggle command. (toggle 'ansi color')

The valid COLORs are as follows:

Fore Ground                Back Ground
FG_BLACK                    BG_BLACK
FG_RED                      BG_RED
FG_GREEN                    BG_GREEN
FG_YELLOW                   BG_YELLOW
FG_BLUE                     BG_BLUE
FG_MAGENTA                  BG_MAGENTA
FG_CYAN                     BG_CYAN
FG_WHITE                    BG_WHITE

The different text types that you can color are as follows:

Say, Gossip, Yell, Tell, Desc, Object List, Critter List,
Default, Background, Battle

Two defaults are offered:  NORMAL and SUGGESTED
Normal is white back ground, rest is black.  Suggested is some colors
I picked out that I kinda like (Though I mostly use Hegemon.)
