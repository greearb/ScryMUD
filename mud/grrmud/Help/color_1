<help general color>

This command allows you to view and change your color settings.  It
does not enable/disable the use of ANSI color however:  That is
done through the toggle command. (toggle 'ansi color')

The valid color codes are as follows:

Fore Ground                Back Ground
^^0 reset to default        &&0 reset to default
^^w white                   &&w white
^^n black                   &&n black
^^c cyan                    &&c cyan
^^m magenta                 &&m magenta
^^b blue                    &&b blue
^^r red                     &&r red
^^g green                   &&g green
^^y yellow                  &&y yellow

foreground colors can me made "bright" by capitalizing their letter. This
will however not work on background colors.

You can combine foreground and background colors by listing the background
color first: &&b^^W will give you bright white text on a blue background.

You can use these colors anywhere you can enter text: your prompt, say, tell,
yell, gossip, emote, descriptions, etc.

If you wish to display a literal ^^ or && you can escape it with itself, i.e. ^^^^
or &&&&.

The different text types that you can color are as follows:

Say, Gossip, Yell, Tell, Desc, Object List, Critter List,
Default, Background, Battle

Two defaults are offered:  NORMAL and SUGGESTED
Normal is white back ground, rest is black.  Suggested is some colors
I picked out that I kinda like (Though I mostly use Hegemon.)

Syntax:  color                  Show current settings.
	 color [text_type] [color]   Set color for text type.
	 color NORMAL           Make everything normal again
	 color SUGGESTED        My personal favorites.
