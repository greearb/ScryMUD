<help general darkling>

The Darklings are the last remnants of a colony of humans who tried
to survice the ancient destruction by going far underground.  Only
recently have they re-joined the surface dwellers, and they still
prefer the dark haunts of their ancestors.

They survive upon the dark energy which inhabits the world; most choose to
dwell underground or in caves, where the energy is strongest.
Most are mindless in their pursuits, choosing instead to
follow their powerful religious leaders.  Darklings are often short-lived,
and may only mate once in their lifetimes.  Their young brood are deposited
deep in the nurturing caves where they feed off of dark energies, sucking
nourishment straight from the earth!

The Drow are those Darklings who, because of destiny or individual will,
have become completely saturated with the dark energy, and can wield it for
their purposes.  Most of the Drow are solitary, though some choose to lead
their fellow Darklings.

The Darklings can be described as humanoid, with an anemic/ghostly complexion.
The black blood that flows through their veins gives their skin a dark tone,
thus the name.  Their hair is almost always black.

Darklings are compatible with almost every race, though, because of their
choice of dwellings, they are often the enemies of the dwarves.  They retain
special knowledge of the dark forces of the world, including dragons of that
nature.
