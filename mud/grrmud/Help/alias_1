<help general alias>

The alias command can be used to add a name (keyword) to
a pet.  An underbar (_) is appended to the end of the alias
to prevent spoofing.  However, because Scry does partial name
matching, this should not be obvious.

Syntax:  alias <<i_th> [target] [new_alias]

Example:  alias 2.guard joebob
