<help immortal force_all>

Similar to force, except with this you specify no target.  Your force
will go out to every PC that is not linkdead.  Of course, you will not
be able to bother those of higher levels than yourself.  Once again,
do not abuse this command..

Syntax:  force_all [action]

Example:  force_all gossip All hail Dagath!!
          force_all gossip Aww hell, Grock!!
