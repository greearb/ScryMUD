<help skills hurl>

This skill allows one to attempt to hurl someone out of the room. 
Damage is done proportional to the person doing the hurling. 
This is not a very exact manuever, so the more exits available,
the better your chance of actually getting the victim out of the
room. 

Syntax: hurl <<<<i_th> [victim]>

Example:  hurl 		Attempt to hurl current opponent
	  hurl 2.guard  Try to hurl the second guard
