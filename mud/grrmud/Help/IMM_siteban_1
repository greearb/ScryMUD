<help immortal siteban>

This command can be used to ban a given IP address, or an entire
subset of IP addresses.  It may also work on hostnames, but that is
dependent on how the code is written in grrmud.cc.  For now, it only
works on IP.  I'll illustrate by example.  If you wanted to ban
the IP address 127.0.0.1, you would simply:  siteban '127.0.0.1'

If instead you wanted to ban everyone from that site, you might do
something like:  siteban '127.0.0.'   (notice the trailing period.)

If you want to only ban newbies from a certain site, prepend N to the
first of the ip address, like:  siteban 'N166.66.66.'

Only level 8 and above immorts can use this command.  Please see
the 'See Also' section, as it has some other, less powerful methods
to dicipline ppl. 

NOTE:  You have to put the single quotes around the IP.

Syntax:  siteban '<<N>[site_to_ban]'

Example:  siteban '207.68.178.'        #Ban an entire subnet or two.
Example:  siteban 'N207.68.178.'       #Ban all newbies from that subnet.
