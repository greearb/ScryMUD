area_mset
Syntax:  area_mset [thing_to_set] [new_value]
Example: area_mset heat_resis 100

Used to set a limited set of values on all mobs within a zone. This command
does not affect teachers or player owned shop keepers.

This command can currently set the following stats (with bounds):
    ac          (-200, 200)   heat_resis   (-100,200)
    cold_resis  (-100, 200)   elect_resis (-100, 200)
    spell_resis (-100, 200)   dam_rcv_mod    (1, 200)

This command always affects the "DB", and requires an "amsave" to make the
changes permanent. You will not immediately see the effects of this command on
mobs which are already loaded in a zone. a "total_rezone" will not update
pre-loaded mobs with the new information. "mstat #" will show the changes, as
will they be reflected on any new mobs that you load. The change will be
evident everywhere in the zone after a server restart.
