<help skills earthmeld>

This skill allows the experienced ranger to bind him or herself to the
earth in such a way that the earth absorbs some of the damage meant
to go to the ranger.  It costs considerable mana to keep this 
connection alive.  If you move out of your immediate surroundings,
the meld is broken.
