<help olc rstat>

This function returns a great deal of information about a given
room.  If you are using the Java Client, then this will capture
some information for easy editing of the room. 

BUGS:  you can only use this method of editing a room if you are
in that room.  Be careful not to rstat another room, then use the
Java Client to make changes, as it will change your current room
instead. 

Syntax:  rstat <<i_th>

Example:  rstat 30			Stat room# 30
