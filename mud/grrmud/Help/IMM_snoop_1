<help immortal snoop>

This command lets you (silently) observe every command a player
enters.  This is a considerable invasion of privacy, so do not
do this just for kicks.  All such activity is logged and will
be reviewed.

You are restricted to snooping PC's only, and you must be at
least level 8 immortal.  You may not snoop those of a higher
immort level than yourself.  You do not have to be in the same
room as your victim.
