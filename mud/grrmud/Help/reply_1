<help communications reply>

This command attempts to send a 'tell' to the last person who 'told' you
something.  This can be a handy shortcut, but it could also be
embarrassing, as you could end up telling the wrong person something
important.

syntax:  reply [message text]

example:  reply Why don't you come... rescue me from this boring man!
