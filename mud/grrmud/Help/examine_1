<help general examine>

This is the command that allows you to peek into a container.  It
will show all of the items an open container holds.  Of course,
if you haven't the ability to view a object, like its invisible
and you can't detect invisibility, you will not see it. 

Syntax:  examine <<i_th> [target]
