<help olc zlock>

This function locks the specified zone.  No mobiles can move except for
those with builder status.  Also, nothing should automatically load in
the zone.  It should, in short, remain static.  You can only manipulate
zones you have permission to edit.

syntax:  zlock <<zone_number>

Example:  zlock                    // lock current zone
	  zlock 10                 // lock zone 10

NOTE:  You MUST lock a zone before you can write it, and before any of
        this you should do a <total_rezone> to read ALL objects into the
        zone.  Otherwise you would lose any object that didn't load if
        you use <write_zone> to write your zone to disk.

NOTE: Due to my parse system, you must be in zone number 1 in order to
       	zlock it.  The rest should work from anywhere.
