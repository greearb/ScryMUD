<help skills bash>

Bash is a fairly simplistic skill learned by some people interested
in armed combat.  It attempts to stun a person for a short time.  During
this time the opponent, if the attack is successful, will be unable to
issue any commands.  The flip side is that the person who instigates the
attack will also be immobile for one to three rounds of battle.  You can
now bash doors (not all will open though).

Syntax:  bash <<i_th> target

Example:  bash 2.guard
	  bash gate

Notes:  You don't have to specify a target if you are already fighting.
