<help general who>  

Lists all players currently playing.  If you wouldn't have the ability
to see them, in their current room, then they will just show up as 
Someone.

If the level has IMM in it, it is an immortal.  If it has RMT in it,
then it is a Remort, someone who has gone all the way to level 30 and
then started over, at least once.

Syntax:  who
