<help skills sneak>

Sneak allows one to enter and exit rooms silently.  Some sharp
eyed people will catch you every now and then, but for the most
part they have to look hard to notice you. 

Example:  sneak

NOTE:  to un-sneak, just type sneak again.  Also, entering into battle
	and other active things makes you stop sneaking of course!!
