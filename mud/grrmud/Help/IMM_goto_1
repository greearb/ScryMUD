<help immortal goto>

This command is used to goto any mob detectable by the pc, or any room.
Going to a mob in this fashion is CPU intensive so don't use it
frivously.

           goto <<n_th> [mob_name]   //not so effecient
                 

examples:  goto 1	Takes you to room numbered 1, Garland Temple
