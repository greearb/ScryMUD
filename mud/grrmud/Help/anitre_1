<help general anitre>


        To the east of the great plains is a great sea.  The
Anitre live on, and across the sea, traveling the waters as other
people travel the land.  Anitre have either light blue or light
green skin and have gem colored eyes but are otherwise similar to
humans.  They usually are quite vain about their appearance, for
their culture greatly values beauty.  They love the sea, and the
sea loves them.  They value independence do not appear to have a
centralized leadership.  However, their politics are so
complicated that no one, including the Anitre, understands is
completely.  Travellers in their lands are welcome as long as
they stay out of the more traditional and sacred areas.  Those
that choose to wander where they will are sometimes found
mutilated as if by a pack of wolves. Many believe that the Anitre
can talk with animals, and all agree that they hold a deep
affinity for those of hoof, claw, and fin.  Sometimes, in hushed
tones, one may hear even stranger tales from wizened men of ages.
