<help general dwarf>

        Dwarves are a very secretive lot. Most of them stay in
their lands and never leave. They love metals and craftmanship as
much as they love their ale and stories after work in the
taverns. Gruff and quiet amongst others they become a lively
bunch with their own kind. They tend to live in the northern
mountain ranges in tunnels and strongholds clinging to the sides
of cliffs.  They put a lot of stock in the idea that they are led
by a higher being. Clerics are very much respected regardless of
what race they are from.  Strangers are allowed into their lands
but only so far.  The deep warrens and secret tunnels are off
limits to all but respected dwarves.  </help>
