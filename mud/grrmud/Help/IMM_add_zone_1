<help general add_zone>

Allows you to add a zone to the 'active' database.  This is
different from create_zone by the way.  Active zones mean that
by default they will be zunlocked and ready for mortal players
when the mud starts up.

Syntax:  add_zone [i_th]

Examples:  add_zone 5  # add zone 5 to the playable zones.
