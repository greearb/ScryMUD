<help immortal teach>

This command teaches a person a skill.  You must be level 5
immort or more to use this.  It may be further restricted in the
future.  It definately will if someone abuses it.  One should
never teach a mortal anything, except as prizes for quests, and
perhaps debugging if we're in beta still. 

Syntax:  teach <<i_th> [target] <<prcnt_lrnd> [skill_name]

Example:  teach shamu 50 'bodyslam'

Notes:  It can only be used on PC's.  They can
be anywhere in the game, but must be logged on and not link-dead. 
If the skill name is two words, you must surround it in single
quotes as usual.  </help>
