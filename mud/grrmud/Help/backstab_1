<help skills backstab>

This is a very powerful skill.  If you are sneaky enough, and have the
right weapon, you may gain a huge advantage over an advesary who is not
expecting to be attacked.  Note that you can't backstab with just any old
weapon, it has to be specially designed to pierce.

Syntax:  bs <<i_th> [victim]
	 backstab <<i_th> [victim]

Example:  bs guard
