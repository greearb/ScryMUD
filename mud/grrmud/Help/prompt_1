<help general prompt>

This command is used to customize your prompt to your liking.  Soon
Java Client users should have better options...

syntax:  prompt <<'prompt_string'>  where prompt string is as 
   described below:

     The prompt_string is any list of characters terminated by a
<return>.  You can make the game insert certain things into the
prompt with special letter combinations as follows: 

%h	current hit points	%H	maximum hit points
%v	current mov points	%V	maximum mov points
%m	current mana points	%M	maximum mana points
%%      a '%' symbol
%N      Newline


If you imput NORMAL as your prompt string you are set to the
default, which is something similar to:  <<%hH %mM %vV >

Example:  prompt '<<%H/%hH %M/%mM %V/%vV >'
	  prompt NORMAL
<color=red>

NOTE:  You MUST include the prompt string in single quotes.
