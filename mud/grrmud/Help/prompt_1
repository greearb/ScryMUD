<help general prompt>

This command is used to customize your prompt to your liking.  Soon
Java Client users should have better options...

syntax:  prompt <<'prompt_string'>  where prompt string is as 
   described below:

     The prompt_string is any list of characters terminated by a

prompt with special letter combinations as follows: 

%h	current hit points	%H	maximum hit points
%v	current mov points	%V	maximum mov points
%m	current mana points	%M	maximum mana points
%a      alignment               %p      practices
%x      experience points       %X      experience to level
%g      gold on hand            %G      gold in bank
%1      medical conditions      %2      visibility conditions
%R      room name               %E      visible exits
%w	weight being carried	%W	max weight
%%      a '%' symbol            %N      Newline

Note on medical conditions:
(hun)   Hungry                  (thi)   Thirsty
(dru)   Drugged

Note on visibility conditions:
(snk)   Sneaking                (hid)   Hiding

If you imput NORMAL as your prompt string you are set to the
default, which is something similar to:  <<%hH %mM %vV >

Example:  prompt '<<%H/%hH %M/%mM %V/%vV >'
	  prompt NORMAL
<color=red>

NOTE:  You MUST include the prompt string in single quotes.
