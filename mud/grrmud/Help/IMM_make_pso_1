<help olc make_pso>

This allows you to make a regular shopkeeper into a player-run
shop keeper.  You must be the owner of the mob to do this.  Also,
you will probably want to use mset to set the manager eventually,
though only high level (9+) imms can do this.

Syntax:  make_pso <<i_th> [shopkeeper_name]

Example:  make_pso 2.shopkeeper
