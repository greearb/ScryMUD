<help communications discuss>

This command may allow you to gain valuable information from a computer
or sentient controlled player.  (Who says aliens haven't hacked the net
yet!!)  This command is no longer being actively supported, but it
does work in one zone.  It will be removed from there when I get some
time.  Say and tell are now the commands of choice for communicating
with characters.

Syntax:  discuss [topic] <<i_th> [target]

Example:  discuss 'love potion' esmerelda
	  discuss quest knight
