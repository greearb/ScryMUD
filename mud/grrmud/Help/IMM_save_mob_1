<help olc save_mob>

This command is strange and powerful.  It will allow you to change a
SMOB (a modified Mobile) back into a MOB (unmodified).  It isn't always
perfect, but it's a good way to give an already built mob another
piece of EQ for example.  You must do an asave to make it permanent.

Syntax:  save_mob <<i_th> [mob_name]

Example:  save_mob 2.guard
