<help general sacrifice>

This command is used to allow a person ready for level 31 to sacrifice
a certain 'worth' of items in order to be able to remort.  The worth is
calculated based on the stat-modifiers of the objects.  For instance,
a +10HP, -5MANA shield would have a worth of +5.  Curently, you must
have at least 100 points in order to sacrifice.  If you use the sacrifice
command with no arguments, it will just report on your current number
of sac points.  If you are ready to really sacrifice, then you should
use the syntax:  sacrifice DO_IT

NOTE:  Only items in your INVENTORY will be counted/sacrificed.
NOTE:  YOU WILL LOSE ALL OF YOUR INVENTORY WHEN YOU SACRIFICE!!

syntax:  sacrifice <<DO_IT>
