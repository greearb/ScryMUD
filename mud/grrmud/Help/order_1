<help general order>

This command allows you to control your pets.  It is quite powerful,
but you must remember that you can't force a pet beyond its own
limitations, whatever they may be.

syntax:  order [i_th] <<pet> <<command string>    Order one pet.
         order followers <<command string>  	Order all pets.

example:  order fol get sword		All will attempt to get a sword.
          order fol fol			All will follow themselves now.
