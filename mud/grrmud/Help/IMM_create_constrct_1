<help olc create_constrct>

This command allows you to create a construction.  For example,
if you want a player to be able to find several components, and
then construct them into some othe object, this is the command
to allow that.  All objects you are dealing with must be created,
and you must have ownership of them (in OLC terms).  You will get
appropriate errors if this is not the case.

This command does not check to see if the objects in question are
already part of a construction.  An object can only be a component
of one construction or concoction.  If you use this command on an
object that is part of another, it will become a part of the new one
you are creating, but the old one it was part of will be wierd, at
best.

There is not an easy way to fix a screwed up concoction, so you might
have to oclear objects if you can't get them fixed.  First, though, ask
me (Grock, or your fellow IMP), I might can fix it up for you...

You must do an aosave in every zone that you modified objects in.  Unless
you are working on several zones at once, it is most likely that you will
only have to do this in one zone, your current one.

Syntax:  create_construction [targ_obj_num] [comp1_num] ... [comp5_num]

Example:  create_construction 6 9 10 11 200 7      
            # Object number 6 can now be constructed if the player has the
            # objects numbered 9, 10, 11, 200 and 7. (And has the
            # construct skill and paraphanalia.

Example:  create_construction 6 7 9
            # Object number 6 can now be constructed if the player has
            # the objects numbered 7 and 9 (only).
