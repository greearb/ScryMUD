<help olc mset>

Used to set values on a mob or pc.  They must be in your current room.
This can be used in conjunction with 'amsave' to permanently change
the data base.  Note that some changes are restricted to only the
highest players.  No immortal can change a higher-level immortal's
stats, and no immortal below level 9 can change a pc's stats.

If you wish to modify the database directly, without worrying about
whether or not your target is a MOB or SMOB, then use DB for the
mob name, and make i_th the mob number.  See NOTE at bottom.

Syntax:  mset		// shows what you can set
         mset <<i_th> [mob] [thing_to_set] [new_value]
         mset <<i_th> DB    [thing_to_set] [new_value]

Example: mset
	 mset 2.warrior max_hp 365   //set warrior's max_hp to 365
         mset 195 DB max_hp 365      //set mob number 195's max_hp to 365

NOTE:  If your target is a MOB as apposed to a SMOB 
        (mstat will tell you)
        then you will be changing the database, otherwise, only that
       	particular target will be affected, not the database.
       	You still must do an amsave to make changes to DB permanent.
