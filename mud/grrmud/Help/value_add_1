<help general value_add>

This allows the manager of a shopkeeper to add an entry
for a given object.  The player must have this object in
his/her inventory for this command to work.  After adding
a new entry, you will most likely want to set new values.
Use value_list to figure out it's index, and value_set
(or the Hegemon GUI) to set the new values.

Syntax:  value_add <<i_th> [shopkeeper_name] <<j_th> [object_name]
         
Example:  value_add shopkeeper sword    
Example:      # Adds default entry for the sword.
