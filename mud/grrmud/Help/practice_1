<help general practice>

This is how you gain the ability to do skills and spells.  A
guildmaster of your class must be present to teach you.  If
given no arguments, practice will show you what you already know. 

NOTE:  You have to suround multi-word skills/spells with single
       quotes.

Syntax:  practice ['spell/skill'] <<<<i_th> [teacher]>

Example:  practice illuminate		Teaches you illuminate
	  practice			Same as 'abilities'.
