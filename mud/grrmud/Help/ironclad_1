Ironclads:

Fierce are the Ironclads, warriors without fear or eqaul in this
world of chaos and fire.  In massive armor they stream out from
the Dwarven halls and strike fear into all those who would seek
to do injustice unto the Dwarves, or those under their aegis. 
The warsongs of the Ironclads fill the canyons and dells within
Dwarven mounts, proclaiming their fierce honor and pride.  And
prideful they are, a pride they defend with axe and blade, hammer
and club, knowing that should they die, heaven awaits them.  Even
among their Dwarven kin are they feared and respected, both for
the bloodlust that runs through their body and the restraint that
holds back the berserker rages, always in check, waiting, silent,
for the call of blood to bring it forth.  </help>
