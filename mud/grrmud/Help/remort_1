<help general remort>

When your character is ready to rise to level 30, you are ready to
remort. Remorting is like being reborn, but with some of the knowledge
of your previous level 29 character. You can choose a new class and you
will gain the base skills and spells of that class.

In addition to starting as a level 1 character, you will get 3 points
to permanently add to your stats (like str, dex, int, etc).

Remorts are like regular players in every way, and may rise to level 29
and choose to remort again. At that point, you may choose a new race to
become.

When you are ready to remort, you must sacrifice enough loot to appease
the gods, and then find an immortal player to remort you.
