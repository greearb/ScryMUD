<help general remort>

This command, used by a high level immort, may transform a mortal of
a certain race/class to a different race/class.  The player will start
over with all skills/spells intact, but will have their HP, MANA, and
MOV reset to a lower level.  They will be given the base spells for
their new class if that is needed.

The immortal may also grant a TOTAL of +3 to one or more stats:
STR, CHA, INT, CON, DEX, WIS.  That will have to be done through
the mset command.

NOTE:  The player must have sacrificed prior to the remort (the code
will check.)  The player must also have an empty inventory, and not
be wearing anything.

NOTE:  Mortals can only re-mort into a different class.  Remorts that
are ready to re-mort again may choose to change both class and race.
It is not necessary that they mortal change either or class.

syntax:  remort <<i_th> [player] [new_race] [new_class]
