<help olc add_mob_script>

(Can now be used on rooms and objects too!!)

This function, though a bit unwieldy, allows you to add or modify a
script for some room, object or mob.  If the entity already has a script
triggered by what you specify here, then it will be over-written.  After
entering this command, you will be prompted to input the script.  In your
script, there are certain variables you can put in: 
%%                             Percent Sign
%M                             Actor's Name
%m                             Target's Name, if it's a MOB
%o                             Target's Name, if target is an Object
%S                             The Entity 'executing' the script.

An example script for a mob might be:  
(Suppose the trigger is when the actor types wear dagger, and the
dagger's Vnum is the same as the target number for the script.) 

say %M, that's a sharp %o you have there, better be careful!;;
pause 1;;
emote glances again at the dagger and starts hammering on his latest sword.;;

NOTE:  Enter all this at once, on one line.
usage:  add_mob_script [mob_num] [trigger_cmd] [actor_num]
		       ['discriminator_string'] [target_num]
		       [takes_precedence]
usage:  add_room_script [rm_num] [trigger_cmd] [actor_num]
		       ['discriminator_string'] [target_num]
		       [takes_precedence]
usage:  add_obj_script [obj_num] [trigger_cmd] [actor_num]
		       ['discriminator_string'] [target_num]
		       [takes_precedence]

NOTE:  If 'discriminator_string' is a number, prepend DESCRIM_ to it or
       it will not work, for example:  DESCRIM_55

Arguments:
   mob_num/rm_num is the number of the entity which should get this script

   trigger_cmd:  Should be one of the commands we support:
   	close, donate, drop, eat, enter, examine, exit, fill, follow,
   	get, give, group, hit, list, lock, "look, meditate, open, order,
	pay, prone, remove, rest, say, shoot, sit, slap, sleep, stand, tell,
        throw, ungroup, unlock, wake, wear, yell
   actor_num:  The mob which can trigger this script, if -1 then it can be
	anyone

   discriminator_string:  An optional trigger condition, designed for
	communications, but has extensions that now work for other
	commands.  For the communications (say, yell, tell), it will
        match any string which contains it, and it is NOT case sensitive.
	NOTE:  If a few cases, where there is a target involved, and also
	another object, like: give [obj] [critter], the
	discriminator_string will be the number of the OBJECT involved.
	NOTE:  Use 'NA' (no quotes) if you don't want or need a 
               descriminator. 

	On non-communication triggers, the following discriminators
	can be used:  FEM, MALE, NEUTER, BARD, CLERIC, WARRIOR, SAGE
		WIZARD, THIEF, ALCHEMIST, HUMAN, ANITRE, DARKLING,
		DRAGON, DWARF, OGRUE, ELF, UNDEAD, ANIMAL, MONSTER
	When added, these have the meaning of 'only'.  So, if you make
	FEM your desriminator, then the script will only be triggered
	on FEMALES.  You can add several by doing something like:
	FEM.THIEF.ELF, which will mean that this script will only work
	on a female, elven thief.

	SPECIAL DISCRIMINATORS FOR CERTAIN TRIGGERS:
	--------------------------------------------

	enter:  The discriminator is the direction entered from:
	        above, below, north, northwest, northeast, east, southeast,
		south, southwest, west

	put:    The discriminator is the object number of the bag.  Enter
		-1 if it can be any container.

   target_num:  This can be a MOB or OBJECT number, which ever makes sense
	to the trigger command.
   takes_precedence:  If this action should pre-empt already-running
	scripts, enter anything but zero (0), if NOT, then enter a zero
	(0).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Scripting Commands:
	pause, exact_damage, oload, mload, affect_hp, affect_mana,
        affect_mov, is_greater_than, is_less_than, is_equal_to,
	is_in_posn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

   NOTE:  the use of the 'pause' command can be very useful, as it helps
to space out the mobs actions.  The pauses are the length of a round of
battle, about 2-3 seconds each. 

   NOTE 2:  You must do an amsave/asave/aosave in the zone that the entity
belongs to in order to have your changes made permanent through a reboot.
mstat/rstat/ostat will give you the zone that the entity belongs to. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Caveats:  Only one command per line.  Comments not implemented at
	this time.  Your 'if' construct must have an else statement,
	even if it is empty.  Note that each command must end with
	double semi-colons.

Comforts:  You should be unable to seriously harm the game, no matter
	what awful script you write!  Bad loops could waste resources
	though.


Expanded Scripting Capability:
==============================

NOTE:  square brackes should not be used in the actual script, they
are just used to delineate commands in the examples below.

Defining what Entity is to take the script action:
--------------------------------------------------
Currently all commands are from the perspective of the mob/room/obj that
'owns' the script.  Now you may specify the commands to be 'executed'
by other actors.  For instance, suppose you wanted to check if the
actor had a specific piece of eq in his/her inventory?  The answer
to this problem is found below.

To specify that the action should be taken by someone else, use this
syntax:

	Action to be taken by the actor:
**%M [normal script command]		

	Action to be taken by the target.
**%m [normal script command]

	Action to be taken by script owner (this is the default).
**%S [normal script command]

	Action to be taken by target, if target is an object.
**%o [normal script command]

For instance, in this example we query whether or not the actor has
object #44 in his/her possession.

**%M if does_own 44
