<help olc set_path_pointer>

Vehicles (non-player-guided ones at least) have an array of PathCells that
the vehicle goes through in order to know where to go next.  This command
lets you explicitly set the current PathCell to a given index number.

I would imagine this will only prove useful while you are building or
modifying the route for some vehicle.  This could be pretty tricky,
so be sure to ask your IMP if you have troubles.  Please read the
related help pages first though.

Syntax:  set_path_pointer [vehicle_num] [new_index]

Example:  set_path_pointer 25 2     The vehicle is now at the path cell
                                    at index 2.
