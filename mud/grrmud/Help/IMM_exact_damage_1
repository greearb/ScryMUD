<help battle exact_damage>

This command, written with scripting in mind, exacts a certain
amount of damage from the caller.  It also causes the caller to
emote a message, if one is specified.

NOTE:  Need single quotes around the message.

Syntax:  exact_damage [dice_count] [dice_sides] <<'command'>

Example:  exact_damage 5 6	# Does 5d6 damage to caller, no msg is emoted.
Example:  exact_damage 4 4 'is consumed in a flash of white heat.'
