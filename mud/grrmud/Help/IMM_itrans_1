<help immortal itrans>

Transport mobs or pc's in your CURRENT room to any valid room.  You
can trans any pc, who is not linkdead (which can be easily changed
if need appears), to any valid room.

Syntax:  itrans <<i_th> [target] <<rm_num>

Example:  itrans dagath    //trans dagath to your CURRENT room
          itrans shade 666  //trans shade to room 666


Note:  You can only trans someone to room#1 if you are IN this room.
	This is due to parser peculiarities.
