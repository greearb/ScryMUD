<Help olc add_proc>

THIS HAS BEEN DEPRECATED BY THE ADD_MOB_SCRIPT AND RELATED COMMANDS.
Please do not use this command.

This command can allow you to add special procedures to already-written
mobs.  Just follow the prompts and remember to do an aosave when completed.

Note that if you do a 'reset_olc', you will have effectively done a
'mclear' on it.  This could be messy, but hopefully not fatal.  Please
avoid this.

Syntax:  add_proc [mob_number]

Example:  add_proc 50		//add some proc to mob 50
<color=red>
See Also:  rm_give_proc, rm_bow_proc, rm_curse_proc, rm_say_proc
