<help olc tog_rflag>

Used to toggle room flags.  Automatically called on caller's CURRENT ROOM.
See also tog_zflag, which toggles room flags in the entire zone.

syntax:  tog_rflag <<flag_num>

example:  tog_rflag 3 		Toggles flag # 3 of CURRENT ROOM

Bugs:  Some flags are (and should be) restricted from toggling.  As
       an Imp adds/deletes/changes flags, he/she should check this
       and similar functions for possible tweaking.
