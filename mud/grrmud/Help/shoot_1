<help battle shoot>

This is how you instigate ranged combat.  You must have the right
kind of weapon and ammunition if your weapon requires it.  Beware
that mobiles don't take kindly to being shot, many will come hunt
you down and do their best to kill you!  Also, if you shoot at
someone who is already fighting you may hit someone you do not
intend to hit.  You can shoot only one room away in any given
direction. 

Syntax:  shoot <<i_th> [direction] <<j_th> [target]

Examples:  shoot east 2.guard
	   shoot up heroine		Should get pretty high!
