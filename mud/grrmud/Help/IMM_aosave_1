<help olc aosave>

This saves all objects belonging to the zone you designate, or the default,
which is the one you are in when you give the command.  It is destructive in
that the old object database on disk is destroyed, written over.  This 
command is useful for fine tuning your objects for your zone.  This is also
a way you can permanently (almost) delete an object from the database if
you no longer want it.

Syntax:  aosave <<zone_num>         //attempt to save objects in zone 
                                   //[zone_num]
         aosave			   //attempt to save objects in current zone

Example:  aosave 15
	  aosave
<color=red>
See Also:  asave, amsave, oset, oclear
</color>
Note:  You can only use this command on zones you are an owner of.
