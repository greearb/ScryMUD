<help general buy>

This is how you attempt to buy things from a shopkeeper.  There must be
a shopkeeper present in your room in order for this to work.  You can
also buy things from a vending machine like this.

The numbers in brackets to the left (when seen in list)can be used
in place of names when buying stuff.  For example, if you saw this:

<<33H 109M 107V >  list
These items are for sale:
  [1]        a scroll of armor                    8300
  [2]        a scroll of teleportation            8430

You could buy 2, or you could buy 2.scroll, both will be the
scroll of teleportation.

Syntax:  buy <<i_th> [item] <<<<j_th> [shopkeeper/machine]>

Example:  buy waybread
	  buy waybread baker
	  buy 3.sword 2.blacksmith
	  buy ticket machine
