<help general sleep>

Get some serious rest.  You are at the mercy of your fellow
denizens when asleep, and are at a real disadvantage if they want
to mess you up! 

Syntax:  sleep

The sleep spell can put a creature into a sleep that they cannot
awaken from naturally, at least for some time (about 3-15 ticks).
Battle and a few other things can awaken a person from this forced
sleep however.

Syntax:  cast sleep <<i_th> [target]
