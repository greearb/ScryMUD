<help olc oset>

Used to set values on an object.  This object can either be in your
current room or in your inventory.  It checks your inventory first.
This can be used in conjunction with 'aosave' to permanently change
the data base.  This DOES NOT turn the target into a SOBJ.

Syntax:  oset		// shows what you can set
         oset <<i_th> [object] [thing_to_set] [new_value]

Example: oset
	 oset wand charges 50	//set wand's charges to 50
<color=red>
See Also:  mset, rset, aosave, tog_oflag, sobj
</color>
NOTE:  If your object is a OBJ as apposed to an SOBJ
       (ostat will tell you)
       then you will be changing the database, otherwise, only that
       particular object will be affected, not the database.
