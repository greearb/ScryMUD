<help olc flip_door>

The internal door code is a bit messy for efficiency's sake.  For
this reason when you create a door, it may exit to the OPPOSITE side
that you want it to exit to.  If this is the case, you can
'flip_door' to reverse it.  This is quite strange, because it only
flips one side of the door, the other side (in another room) remains
the same.  For you coders:  the side of a door which faces a given
room is determined by the sign of the destination room's number.

syntax:  flip_door <<n_th> [direction_of_door]

example:  flip_door 1.oaken	Flips first door of name 'oaken'.
