<help immortal force>

This is similar to 'order', but it is unconditional if your level 
is high enough with respect to your target.  It will be as if your
target typed in whatever you force them to do.  Use this with
some restraint or it will be more closely monitored.  Also, it
shows the target what they have been forced to do, and by whom.

Syntax:  force [target] [action]

Example:  force levander gecho I will write a GUI client for this MUD!!
          force grock gecho Rock on brother Levander!
          force newbie gossip What's a GUI?
