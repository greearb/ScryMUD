<help general passwd>

This is the command used to change your player's password.  Note that
these passwords are not entirely secure, so don't use the same password
here that you use for other accounts.  Note that you have to type
the new one twice to cut down on careless mistakes.

Syntax:  passwd [old_password] [new_password] [new_password]

Example:  passwd cheese cheesier cheesier
