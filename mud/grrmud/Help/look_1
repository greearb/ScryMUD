<help general look>

This command shows you all in your immediate room, all that you
can detect easily that is.  You can also look at specific
objects, people, and doors for more detailed descriptions of
each.  Note that some things exist in a room, but may be
impossible to see if you don't know exactly what to look for (ie
it's name). 

Also, you can look at the sky to see if you are indoors or not.

If you are trying to look into a bag or a buletin board, try
using the examine command.
