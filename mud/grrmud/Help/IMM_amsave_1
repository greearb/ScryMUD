<help olc amsave>

This saves all mobss belonging to the zone you designate, or the default,
which is the one you are in when you give the command.  It is destructive in
that the old mob database on disk is destroyed, written over.  This 
command is useful for fine tuning your mobs for your zone.  This is also
a way you can permanently (almost) delete an object from the database if
you no longer want it.  In case of accidents, there is a duplicate copy
saved in your OLC_DIR, but there is no online way to mess with it.

Syntax:  amsave <<zone_num>         //attempt to save mobs in [zone_num] 
         amsave			   //attempt to save mobss in current zone

Example:  amsave 15
	  amsave
<color=red>
See Also:  asave, aosave, mset, mclear
</color>
Note:  You can only use this command on zones you are an owner of.
