<help general roll>  

Does a random dice roll, given a number of dice and the number of
sides per dice.  This was suggested to aid rollplaying, and so is open
to both mortals and immortals.  There is also a social by this name,
so you have to enter numbers for this dice functionality.

Syntax:  roll [dice_count] [dice_sides]

Example: roll 4 5                #  This simulates the sum of 4 dice,
                                 #  of 5 sides each, being rolled (randomly).
                                 #  Some of you may think of this as:  4d5
