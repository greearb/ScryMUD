<help olc tog_zflag>

Used to toggle a room flag in every room in your CURRENT zone.

syntax:  tog_zflag <<flag_num>

example:  tog_zflag 3 		Toggles flag # 3 in current zone.

Bugs:  Some flags are (and should be) restricted from toggling.  As
       an Imp adds/deletes/changes flags, he/she should check this
       and similar functions for possible tweaking.
