<help general help>
		Welcome to ScryMUD!

The user interface of Scry is terse and concise. Almost any command can be 
abbreviated by leaving the last few letters off. Be careful making them too 
short, as if it is ambiguous, the first command will be chosen.

When there are more than two of something you wish to specify, say swords in 
the room, you can specify the second sword by typing:
        get 2.sword
or      get 2 sword
In the help files, the "2" above is the i_th sword.

Feel free to ask any IMM players logged in, identified by the 'who' command, 
if you have any questions about anything in the game.

Some useful commands to get started:
        wear all
        gossip Hello, everyone!!
        examine bag
        get all bag

Examples of using the help system:
        help commands
        help 'strength conditioning'
                (Help for multiple word topics should be surrounded by 
                single quotes. This goes for casting multiple word spells, too.)
