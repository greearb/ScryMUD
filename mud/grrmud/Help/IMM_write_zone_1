<help olc write_zone>

This command has an alias, 'asave', which is most often used and
referred to.  This command saves your current zone, or a zone you
specify to permanent storage.  It saves the position of all mobs
and objects currently in the zone, and if someone has slayed your mob
and not re-loaded it, then it will obviously not be saved as part of
the zone.  You should still be able to mload or oload it though.

You cannot save a zone which has not been 'zlock'ed, and you should
be very carefull about zunlocking a zone, zlocking a zone, and saving
it, as the mobs may move or be changed while it is zunlocked.

syntax:  write_zone <<zone_number>
syntax:  asave <<zone_number>

NOTE:   You must also be the OWNER of the zone to write it out.  This
	is to provide a little security.  

NOTE:   To write zone 1 you must be IN the the zone.  The rest should
	work as expected.
