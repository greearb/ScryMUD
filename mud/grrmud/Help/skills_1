<help skills skills>

ScryMUD has a (unique??) skill system.  It is tree-based, meaning you
must learn the prerequisites before you can learn the next skill or
spell.  For instance, you can't very well write scrolls untill you can
read, so LITERACY is a prerequisite for SCRIBE.  For more information
on the various skills, try help [skill/spell name], or better yet,
look at ScryMUD's web page, where every skill is listed.
