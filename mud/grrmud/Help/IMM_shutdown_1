<help immortal shutdown>

Takes the system down peacefully.  Pc's are all saved, but zones
are not, which shouldn't be a problem.  Before bringing it down,
make sure anyone doing OLC has saved their changes if necessary. 
If you add the complete argument, then the game will not come
back up automatically!! 

Syntax:  shutdown <<complete>

Example:  shutdown         // reboot the game, back in 1-3 minutes
          shutdonw complete// down untill someone logs into the
                           // server's account and starts
                           //   it with the 'startup' command.
          shutdown NEW_DB  // Cause a new world to be loaded
