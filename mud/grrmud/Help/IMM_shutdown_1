<help immortal shutdown>

Takes the system down peacefully.  Pc's are all saved, but zones
are not, which shouldn't be a problem.  Before bringing it down,
make sure anyone doing OLC has saved their changes if necessary. 
If you add the complete argument, then the game will not come
back up automatically!! 

Syntax:  shutdown <<complete>

Example:  shutdown         // reboot the game, back in 1-3 minutes
          shutdown complete// down untill someone logs into the
                           // server's account and starts
                           //   it with the 'startup' command.
***       shutdown NEW_DB  // Cause a new world to be loaded

***  The NEW_DB argument is very powerful.  It causes the startup
script to look for a gmud.new file in the same directory as the
gmud binary.  If found, it will be coppied over the gmud file.
This argument also causes the startup script to look for a
World/wrld.new.tar.gz file.  If that file is found, it will be
un-compressed and un-tarred, over-writing any World files already
in place.

This was written so that I could minimize downtime to the server.

Here are (roughly) the things I do to update my server:
  * Build the new server code. (cvs update, make clean, make)
  * Move the binary to the right place. (mv grrmud ~/mud/grrmud/gmud.new)
  * Build the core files. (make scry_dist_core)
  * Put core files in place. (cp XXX.tar.gz ~/mud/, un-tar it there)
  * Go to my development server and build the new world DB.
	(cd ~/mud_dev/grrmud/World, make new_db)
  * Move the new world db to the production server.
	(mv ../wrld.new.tar.gz ~/mud/grrmud/World)
   
Now, the new world DB should be in place, the new server should be in
place, and I have just blasted the core files (ie help files) over the
old ones.  Now I will shutdown the server and tell it to use the new
files.

  * Log onto the server and type:  shutdown NEW_DB

NOTE: PLEASE BACK UP EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU TRY THIS!!!
