<help olc dclear>

This is similar to mclear, it delets a door_data (the thing you build with
OLC) from the database.  Use adsave AND asave to make the changes permanent.

Syntax:  dclear [door_num]

Example:  dclear 17
<color=red>
See Also:  delete_door, adsave, asave, dstat, dlist
</color>
NOTE:  You must own this door (have built it) to destroy it.

NOTE:  door_num refers to its index, ie the number by it in 'dlist'
