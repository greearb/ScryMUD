<help general value_rem>

This allows the manager of a shopkeeper to remove an entry
at a given index.  Use value_list to find the index you
want to remove.

NOTE:  Be careful about removing several at once, because once
       you remove one, the indexes may change.

Syntax:  value_rem <<i_th> [shopkeeper_name] [index_to_remove]
         
Example:  value_rem shopkeeper 0  # Remove the 0_th entry.
