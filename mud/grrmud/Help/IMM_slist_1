<help immortal slist>

This function lists the spells and skills that may be learned. 
Note that not all have been implemented.  I am trying to start at
the beginning and work down.  UPDATE:  most are now coded, but
all need testing still. 

Syntax:  slist <<begin_number> <<amount_to_list>

Example:  slist 0 20		//  Will list first 20 spells/skills
<color=red>
See Also:  teach, practice, abilities
