<help immortal slist>

This function lists the spells and skills that may be learned. 
There should be a help file for each spell (fully specified, no
abbreviation here).

This also shows the pre-requisites and enables, as well as the
objects which are able to cast this spell (and how many there are
of them currently in the game).  Note that more and
more spells will have their power modified (inversly) by the
number of objects in the game that can cast them.  I am
implementing this to balance the ability to brew potions and
scribe scrolls.

Syntax:  slist <<begin_number> <<amount_to_list>
Syntax:  slist [skill/spell name]

Example:  slist 0 20		//  Will list first 20 spells/skills
