<help immortal possess>

This is similar to charm.  Basically, every input you enter
acts as input that the MOB you are possessing entered.  You will
be limited to the normal restrictions placed on that MOB.

The only way to give commands to your own character is to unpossess
your current victim, or to proceed each command with 'self'.

You are restricted to possessing NPC's only, and you must be at
least level 5 immortal.

syntax:  possess <<i_th> [mob_name]

example:  possess 2.guard

After possession:
example:  gos This is the one I'm possessing.
example:  self gos This is my real character.
