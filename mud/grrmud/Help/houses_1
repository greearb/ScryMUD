Multiple players can combine their houses and multiply their limits.  Five
players combined can buy a fifty-room house, for example.  Ask an immortal for
more information on this.

You get to name and describe your house and its contents yourself, but an
immortal will build the house for you.

If you'd like to buy a house, get in contact with an immortal and they'll 
help you out.  You may only purchase one house.
