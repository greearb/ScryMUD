<help immortal update_CIG>

This command, update_cur_in_game is used to calculate the
current ammount of mobs, and objects in the game.  This is
important for re-pops and object limits.  Because this is
very hard to keep accurate through out the game, I give this
method to force it to re-calculate.  This could take a while,
so it is not recommended that it be used too often.  Also, I
might set it up to run periodically, if it looks like we need
it.

Only level 9 and 10 immortals may use this command.
