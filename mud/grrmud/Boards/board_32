Message_16 from Grock:  new help commands
~
A message from Grock lies here.
~
Help is much more complete now.  I have an entry for every command available.
(I think.)
 
To see a list of imm/builder commands, check out help wizhelp
To see mortal commands and other help entries, try help topics
 
Also, you should be able to paste through ch_rdesc now.  Some flags have
been added, namely agg_evil, agg_neut, agg_good.  
Note that few or no mob procs are actually enabled right now.  This should
change
soon.
 
Enjoy, Grock

Message_15 from Grock:  semicolons
~
A message from Grock lies here.
~
If you want to use a semicolon as a semicolon, and not as a newline, you
must escape it with a backslash.  In otherwords, type backslash-semicolon.
kinda like this:
\;
If this doesn't work, try escaping it with another semicolon.  example:
;;

If you have any problems with this let me know.

Try interacting with the shaman, using bow, discuss, and give.  This is but
a contrived example of what may be built with these simple procs.  Imagine
a quest which could take a person all over the known (and unknown!) world.

~
A message from Dagath lies here.

Ok Id like to remind all that please do not use any onums or mobnums that
belong to others...so for Test area use onums 42-61 and mobnums 32-52
all other numbers i assign to builders for their areas:)
I have been going through current areas reaqlly carefully..a few typos..no big
deal...the biggest probs I have found are some room descriptions are too
short...and the areas arent completed yet:P...
Some builders havnt even come to me for an area yet...so if I do not here from
some of you during this week I am tempted to remove you from roster..
Id like to have a fully operational building staff of about 5-10 builders..
So i will remove the ppl i dont here from to make room for new builders:P
Brad-Dagath...e-mail: Necrosse@aol.com
Id like an area done by all current builders bu end of january..meaning totally
debugged,no mistakes..or very few mistakes etc...ill connect the completed ones
by a road until the areas in between are created:)

Message_12 from Grock:  TYPO fixing for areas
~
A message from Grock lies here.
~
When you get your zone done to the extent that all that remains is typo's or
changes in room descs, contact me and I can mail you your zone file in
plain-text form.  You can then edit it with any common editor (make sure you
export
it as plain text though).  You can mail it back to me and I'll add it into
the MUD in it's new form.  I can do the same for mobs, objects and doors even.

SOme new socials are in....  'help socials'. Also, if you wish to create
your own, check out the web page.  I put an example on it and you can
modify it quite easily to be your own social.  If you would like any
special mob-proc to be linked with it, ie spit on a mob flagged to
respond, and they start kicking yer arse..... just make me a note and I'll
try to set it up as such when I get time. Grock

Check out the skill/spell list on the web page.  Suggestions/modifications

be marked up in a way to better display its tree-like structure.  Feel free
to download the source and do it for me :)  If I get a chance I'll write
a script to do it, but it may be a while...

Message_4 from Grock:  FIX FOR STAIRSTEP EFFECT
~
A message from Grock lies here.
~
I think I fixed the stairstep effect, ie the cursor nevers goes back to the
beginning of the line, it only drops DOWN one line.  If you are having this
problem, type:  toggle carriage
then if that doesn't work, try:  toggle cr
If neither of these work, let me know.  For those of you with no problems
currently, I don't think these things will hurt you, but they probably won't
help
either.
