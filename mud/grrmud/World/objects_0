you are an immortal you probably can't even move around.  You can check out
help for some hint as to how it will be.
	I suppose only a select few will be reading this, so
if you would like to become builder, mail me your desired name and I'll advance
him/her and give you permission to build in the test zone (10).  Many changes
and additions still need to take place so have patience.  The bug and idea
commands work just fine, or you can email me.  Next time you log in you will
be in a more hospitible room, where you can read the message board, and even
post if you wish.  Also, please check out the web page for news and
information:  www.primenet.com/~greear/ScryMUD/scry.html

Dearest Shawna,
	I miss you so much!  I have been captured, overwhelmed by
such evil as you cannot imagine.  They, the dark ones of Mount Null,
would not kill me, but instead keep me bound in coils of their
vile magic as a warning to others.  I am almost completely severed
from the magics that used to course my body so readily, but I
believe I have found a weakness in their bindings.
	I fear this letter may never reach you, instead falling into
the hands of my captors or others who mean us no good.  You, and only
you may decipher the rest of this text.  If never do we meet again,
you must know that I will love and honor your memory untill the end
