Dearest Shawna,
	I miss you so much!  I have been captured, overwhelmed by
such evil as you cannot imagine.  They, the dark ones of Mount Null,
would not kill me, but instead keep me bound in coils of their
vile magic as a warning to others.  I am almost completely severed
from the magics that used to course my body so readily, but I
believe I have found a weakness in their bindings.
	I fear this letter may never reach you, instead falling into
the hands of my captors or others who mean us no good.  You, and only
you may decipher the rest of this text.  If never do we meet again,
you must know that I will love and honor your memory untill the end
of my days!
With never-ending love,
