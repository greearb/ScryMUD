SKILLS_SPELLS:

Here is the format for the SKILLS_SPELLS file.  The parser is too
lame to allow comments within the file :)

This is an example entry from the file.

4                        # Skill/Spell number
4			 # Skill/Spell number
illuminate               # Skill/Spell name
0 55 10 295              # MIN_LVL, Difficulty, mana, scroll_num.  See NOTE 1 below.  
212 -1  pre-reqs         # Pre-requisite skills/spells (gotta learn these first.) -1 terminates.
218 -1  enables          # Skills/Spells this skill/spell enables, -1 terminates.


NOTE 1:
  MIN_LEVEL (0-30), Difficulty (1-100%), mana_cost (zero for skills),
  scroll_num (if any, zero otherwise)

NOTE 2:
  You can put comments after the last 3 lines, at least.  There is no need
  to denote the comments, as anything past the expected values will be ignored.

SS_DESCS:

It's real simple:
SKILL/SPELL NAME
Comment, terminated by a ~ on a line by itself (~<RETURN>)

Example:

absorb blows
This magical spell allows you to absorb some spells, and convert
their hostile power into helpful energy.  However, it can also
backfire and open one up to more than ordinary damage, or even death!
