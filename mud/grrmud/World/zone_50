Entrance to the instructional area
~
You stand outside of the entrance to ScryMUD's newbie learning area.  Beyond
these doors you will learn the basic skills which you will need to survive in
the realm of ScryMUD.  To enter the learning area, you will need to move to the
north.  Type "north" to enter the newbie area and begin your education!  If you
want to have a lesson repeated, just type "look".

Lesson One: Movement
~
Scry has a 10-directional movement system: you can move north, south, east,
west, northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast, as well as up and down. 
To move in any one of these directions, just type the direction and hit enter. 
They can be abbreviated, also, as: n, s, e, w, nw, ne, sw, se, u, d.  You
should be able to see a list of visible exits from your room by typing "exits",
or by looking below the room's description.  If you are using Hegemon, the
directional pad will also change colors when an exit is visible.  In additional
to the 10 standard exits, the 'enter' command will allow you to move in
non-standard directions.  There is not always a non-standard exit from a room,
and they do not show up on the visible exits list, so it is up to you to find
them.  To use the enter command, type 'enter keyword', where keyword is the
name of what you want to enter.  Lastly, there are doors which you can open and
close.  To open a door, type 'open door'.  Some doors are locked, and you will
need a key to open those doors.  Some doors can also be hidden, so you might
not see them without some investigation.  Now, move to lesson two.  It is west
of here.

Introduction to ScryMUD
~
Welcome to ScryMUD!  Scry is a place where people of all ages can come to enjoy
themselves.  If you're unfamiliar with Scry's commands and interface, head
north of here to start learning!

Lesson Two: Communication
~
Scry has various methods, called "channels", which you can use to communicate. 
The first of these is "say".  Typing "say Hello!" will send a message to
everyone that is in your current room.  Another channel is "gossip".  Typing
"gossip Hello!" will send a message to everyone in the game who is not asleep,
meditating, deaf, or has gossip turned off.  Other channels are:
tell: Typing "tell grock Hello!" will send a message only to Grock.  Typing
"reply Hello!" will send a message to the last person who sent a tell to you.
shout: Typing "shout Hello!" will send a message to everyone near you.
yell: Typing "yell Hello!" will send a message to everyone in the game.  This
is for emergencies.
emote: emote will send a message to everyone in your current room, but in the
third-person.  If your name was Joe, typing "emote smiles." would display "Joe
smiles.".
Channels like gossip and yell are what are called "global" channels, in that
they broadcast a message to everyone in the game.  People might get mad at you
if you use these channels too much, or "spam" them.
Now, move to lesson three.  It is down from here.

Lesson Three: Configuration and Color
~
Scry has various options that can be turned on and off.  To get a list of these
options, type "toggle".  Here are some of the important ones and their
meanings:
brief: Brief controls whether you see room descriptions or not.  We recommend
you leave this turned off because you might miss important information
otherwise.
Autoloot: autoloot controls whether you automatically loot corpses after you've
killed something or not.
no beep: This controls whether you can be beeped via the "beep player" command.
You might miss important announcements if you have this off.
Scry also has ANSI color for those who aren't using Hegemon.  Hegemon has its
own form of color which is turned on automatically when you enter the game.  To
turn on ANSI color, type 'toggle ansi'.  That will turn color on, but will not
set your color preferences.  Your color preferences are set with the 'color'
command.  For now, type 'color suggested'.  That will put your colors to a
pre-programmed setting.
Now, move to lesson four.  It is east of here.

Lesson Four: Your Character
~
As you probably noticed when you created your character, there were lots of
options to choose from.  Your character's "statistics", like how strong, how
intelligent, and how dextrous he or she is, were all influenced by your choice
of race and class.  Each combination of race and class has its advantages and
disadvantages, and these are permanent in nature and cannot be changed for the
most part.  However, you can make your character more unique.  Let's start by
changing your title.  Type "who".  You will see your name, followed by "the
newbie", followed by your class and level.  To change your title, type 'title
what you want your title to be'.  For example, 'title the fearsome warrior!'. 
You can also change your description.  Type 'look self'.  You will see some
general information about yourself, including "He/She/It looks perfectly
normal."  You can change that to a unique description by typing "describe",
then hitting enter, and then entering your description.  (If you are using
zMUD, a MUD client for Windows, type 'look zmud' first.)  When you are done
with your description, hit enter, and then enter a tilde (~).  You are now
quite a unique person!
Now, move to lesson five.  It is up from here.

~
32 24 23 21 10 9 8 7 6 -1  -:| bitfield |:-
1   Start of KeywordPair
zmud ~
If you're using zMUD, you might have trouble entering a description, because
zMUD uses the tilde (~) for one of its special functions.  To enter a
description you'll need to go up to View, then Preferences, then to Special
Characters.  There you'll need to disable (un-check) the box for the tilde (~).
 This will disable zMUD's keypad movement functions, so you'll have to decide
whether you want to do this or not.  The tilde (~) is also used when posting
messages on boards, so you'll need to disable it if you want to post messages
on bulletin boards, as well.
  
Another way of disabling the tilde is to click on the icon of a computer which
resides in the lower-right corner near the clock.  This will disable parsing. 
Many thanks to Jamie for this suggestion!

Lesson Five: Your Character: Part Two
~
You can also find out more information about your character.  Type 'score'. 
You will see various stats your character has, including gold, experience
points, hit points, mana, and movement points.  Typing 'score long' will give
you a more detailed list.  Now type 'inventory'.  You will see items that you
currently have in your inventory, as well as the amount of gold you have.  Note
that you have a canvas sack in your inventory.  This will be important later
on.
You also have what is called a "prompt".  This is the line at the bottom of
your screen that is enclosed in brackets.  This tells you how many hit points,
mana points, and movement points you have.  This is important to watch in
battle, as it tells you how healthy (or unhealthy!) you are. Now, move to
lesson six.  Is south of here.

Lesson Six: Items
~
As you found out before, you have a canvas sack in your inventory.  This sack
contains some valuable items which will help you start out.  Type 'examine
sack'.  You will see a list of items that are in the sack.  Now, type 'get all
sack'.  This will remove everything from the sack, and place it in your
inventory.  Carrying items in bags like this one is helpful because it helps
keep your inventory clean.  Now, type 'put bread sack'.  This will put a loaf
of bread back into the sack.  Now, type 'get bread sack'.  This will remove the
bread from the sack.
Now that you have everything out of the sack, type 'wear all'.  This will equip
you.  Now, try 'remove dagger'.  This will remove the dagger which you are
wielding.  Now, try 'wear dagger' to wield the dagger again. If you want to
pick up an item that is lying on the ground, type 'get item'.  If you want to
leave an item on the ground, type 'drop item'.  Now, move to lesson seven,
which is west of here.

Lesson Seven: Items: Part Two
~
In your journeys throughout the realm, you will come across many items which
you can use.  In addition to commands like put, get, remove, and wear, you will
be able to use commands like fill, drink, eat, and empty.  Let's try these
commands now.
You have a canteen in your inventory.  Try 'drink canteen'.  You'll feel less
thirsty.  Try it again, until it says you're too full to drink any more, or
your water runs out.  Now, try 'eat bread'.  You'll feel less hungry.  Try it
again until it says you're too full to eat any more, or your bread runs out. 
Now you'll notice that there is a fountain in the room.  Try 'drink fountain'. 
Most likely you'll be too full to drink any more, but normally fountains are
very helpful as they give free water! You can also refill your canteen at the
fountain.  Type 'fill canteen fountain' to refill it, and try it again until
the canteen is full.  Now, move to lesson eight, which is north of here.

Lesson Eight: Items: Part Three
~
Sometimes you'll want to get rid of an item.  If you want, you can just use the
'drop item' command.  Or, if you want to get a little bit of a reward for
getting rid of the item, you can do a 'junk item'.  If you think it's something
that's of value to other people, please use the 'donate item' command which
will leave it in the donation room in Garland where others can make use of it. 
Now, move to lesson nine, which is up from here.

Lesson Nine: Shops
~
Sometimes, you'll want to buy something from a shop.  Most people buy their
food from shops, and some equip themselves with items from shops.  You'll
notice that there is a baker in this room.  To see what he has to sell, type
'list'.  You'll notice that he's selling a loaf of bread.  If you're low on
bread, you might want to buy some now.  To buy bread, type 'buy bread'.  Some
shopkeepers will also allow you to sell items to them, at a reduced price.  To
see how much a shopkeeper wants for your item, type 'offer item'.  To sell an
item, type 'sell item'.  Only some shopkeepers will allow you to sell things to
them.  Now, move to lesson ten, which is south of here.

Lesson Ten: Battle
~
To advance in power, you'll need to gain experience points.  Experience points
are gained through battle.  You can also gain valuable equipment through
battle, once you've killed off whoever is wearing it.  Before you kill
anything, you'll need to make sure you're capable of killing it.  Type
'consider monster' to see if you're capable of killing it.  Be warned, though,
that looks can be deceiving, and consider might not always be right!  Once
you've determined that you can kill something, you will need to attack it.  You
can attack it either by using a surprise attack by casting a spell, or just
typing 'kill monster'.  If it turns out that you're losing, you can type 'flee'
which will attempt to get you out of battle.  You can also set the game to make
you flee automatically with the wimpy command.  Do do this, type 'wimpy #',
replacing # with the number of hit points you want to have left when the game
makes you flee.  It takes one round of battle to make you flee, so make sure
you set it so you have enough hit points to survive anothe rount of battle. 
Take note that if you flee, the fight isn't over - many mobs will hunt you
down!  If you win a fight, you will gain some experience points.  You will also
be able to get everything that your opponent was wearing or had in its
inventory with the 'get all corpse' command.  Now, move to lesson eleven, which
is east of here.

Lesson Eleven: Battle: Part Two
~
So what happens if you lose in battle?  Well, you die!  But don't worry - the
game isn't over!  When you die, you'll lose some of your experience points, and
you'll also be reincarnated at the Temple in Garland.  From there, you'll need
to find your corpse.  Your corpse will be wherever you were fighting.  You'll
need to get back to it quickly, though, because some people and monsters might
see it as a good opportunity to get some equipment!  Don't worry, though -
there are punishments for those who do this! Now, move to lesson twelve, which
is northwest of here.

Lesson Twelve: Skills and Spells
~
I'm sure you're probably wondering how you get cool abilities to help take down
your opponents.  To do this, you'll need to learn skills and spells.  To learn
skills and spells, you'll need "practices".  Practices are sessions where
you'll get to learn part of a skill or spell from a trainer.  The more
practices you have, the more skills and spells you can learn!  You start out
with a certain number of practices to help get you started, and you will get
somewhere between two and six practices every time you increase your level. 
Some skills and spells are more difficult to learn than others, so it might
take more practices to learn one skill than another.
Scry's skill and spell system works like a tree.  You start out at the bottom
of the tree with only a few basic skills and spells you can practice.  Once
you've practiced those skills and spells, you'll gain more that you can
practice and you'll branch out further along the tree.  Not everyone can
practice every skill and spell, so some players might have a particular spell
that you don't, and you might have a special skill that others don't have.  To
see a list of what skills and spells you currently have or can get, type
'abilities'.  Now, more to lesson thirteen, which is southwest of here.

Lesson Thirteen: Learning Skills and Spells
~
When you want to learn a skill or spell, you'll need to find a trainer.  There
is a trainer for each class in the city of Garland, as well as some other towns
and cities.  If you don't know where your trainer is, you can ask over the
gossip channel and someone will help you out.  You'll notice that there's a
trainer in this room.  If you want to learn some skills or spells now, you can
learn them from him.  To learn a skill or spell, first find its name by typing
'abilities'.  Then, you'll need to practice the skill with the practice
command.  If the skill or spell is one word, you can just type 'practice spell
trainer', but if the skill or spell is more than one word, you'll need to
enclose the name of it in single quotes, like so: 'practice 'spell name'
trainer'.  This is so that the game knows that you're trying to practice a
two-word spell.  If you want to be able to remember this simply, just put
quotes around the name of all skills and spells when you are practicing them,
whether they're two words or not.  Now, move to lesson fourteen, which is to
the west of here.

Lesson Fourteen: Using Skills and Spells
~
I'm sure you'll want to learn the skills and spells you learned in the last
lesson.  First, however, you'll need to know a bit more about the skills and
spells.
Most of the skills and spells that players can learn when they're first
starting out are called "base skills".  These skills don't actually do
anything, but they are the fundamental knowledge that you need to have to be
able to learn your branches of skills and spells.  Once you've learned these
base skills you'll be able to practice real skills and spells.
  
Now, once you have some real skills and spells, this is how you will use them:
If you learned a spell, you will use it by typing 'cast spell target'.  Some of
the time you won't need to specify a target, and when a spell name is more than
one word you'll need to put quotes around them like you did when you were
practicing. 
If it is a skill, you'll need to just type the name of the skill to use it,
sometimes specifying a target.  Some skills are automatic and you won't need to
do anything to use them. Now, move to lesson fifteen, which is to the south of
here.

Lesson Fifteen: Logging Out
~
When you want to quit out of Scry, you can just type 'quit'.  Scry does not
have a rent system, so you do not need to deposit your equipment anywhere
before you leave.  To be safe, you can type 'save' before you quit if you want,
although you are saved automatically when you quit.  When you're in the game,
you should save periodically, but please don't make a trigger to save after
every kill as it puts a little bit of load on the machine.  You can log out
from anywhere within the game.  When you are under level 5, you will always log
in in the Temple of Garland, but after level 5 you will log in wherever you
logged out.  If you just close the window or cut the connection, your character
will still be in the game and will be susceptible to being attacked.  "Link
dead" characters, as they are called, are forced to log out automatically after
30 minutes, but for 30 minutes they will be vulnerable.  Now, move to lesson
sixteen, which is to the east of here.

Lesson Sixteen:  The Layout of the Realm
~
Now it's time to get your bearings.  Once you've completed the learning area
you'll be placed in the temple in the city of Garland.  Garland is the main
city in the realm and it is where most events center around.  Garland is shaped
almost symmetrically, and everything leads back to one central point known as
the central plaza.  It is hard to get lost in Garland because you just need to
move in the opposite direction you came to get back to the central plaza!
In Garland you will find many shops, as well as trainers.  There is a plaque in
the central plaza in Garland which will help you get your bearings.
Garland is important, but it is only a small part of the realm.  There are two
other great cities in the realm, Jakarta and Dar Thane.  Dar Thane, to the
north, is home to many thugs and evildoers, whereas Jakarta, to the south, is
more peaceful.  There are numerous other cities and towns spread throughout the
realm, as well as a vast expanse of wilderness to explore!  Now, move to lesson
seventeen, which is to the east of here.

The Rules:  Lesson One
~
Before you can head out into the world, you'll need to become familiar with
Scry's rules.  Most of these are simple, common decency rules and are there for

Lesson Sixteen: The Rules
~
Before you can head out into the world, you'll need to become familiar with
Scry's rules.  Most of these are simple, common decency rules and are there for
your benefit. Head north to learn the rules.

The Rules:  Lesson Two
~
ScryMUD is a place for people of all ages to come and have a good time.  As
such, swearing and vulgarity is frowned upon.  Mild swearing is tolerable from
time to time, but repeated use and/or extreme vulgarity is not.  You will
receive a warning when you overstep the bounds of decency, and if you don't
refrain from using vulgar words you will be silenced.  Move north to continue
learning the rules.

The Rules:  Lesson Three
~
Any and all sexually and racially derogatory remarks and other types of
harassment *will not* be tolerated.  If you harass someone, you *will* be
punished.  Ignorance is no excuse.  Failure to clean up your behavior after
being warned is grounds for character freezing, and if you don't stop after
that, look forward to character deletion and sitebans.  Racial and sexual
harassment are *not* taken lightly.  Move north to continue learning the rules.

The Rules:  Lesson Four
~
Lastly for out-of-character rules: Immortal-mortal relations.  All of Scry's
immortals are easily identifiable by the "IMM" written before their level, like
"(IMM-5)".  Scry's imms do their best to help you out, and since they are doing
all of this out of the goodness of their hearts, try to be nice to them. 
Yelling and screaming at them isn't going to get you anywhere.  If you've got a
problem, talk to an imm about it and they'll help you out to the best of their
ability.  Remember, some imms might not have the capability to do everything
that others can, so your problem might not get solved right away.  Also,
begging for hints and equipment will go unanswered by the imms.  You'll have to
either get help from mortals or find out on your own.  If you have
a problem with an imm, talk with Grock or Shamu about it and they'll help sort
the situation out.  If you have a problem with Shamu, talk with Grock. 
Immortals have a set of rules just like mortals do, and they are expected to
follow the rules too. Now move north for in-character rules.

The Rules:  Lesson Five
~
Now for in-game rules.  Please treat all other players with respect.  You don't
want someone on your case, so don't get on someone else's case.  Killing other
players (known as PKilling) is legal but frowned upon, and there are various
forms of punishment for it, so be prepared to avoid the law if you player-kill
someone!  The same applies for looting other people's corpses.  Stealing other
people's kills by attacking the same mob as they when it's almost dead is also
frowned upon, and players won't like you much if you do it.  Now move north for
the last section of rules.

What to do if you've got problems
~
If you're stuck somewhere or you need help, just ask!  Even if there aren't any
immortals on, the other mortals in the game might be willing to help you out. 
If you find a bug or typo or have an idea, feel free to use the bug, typo, and
idea commands to report them where they'll be read by the immortals and acted
upon.  Now, head north to complete your education!

the realm of ScryMUD.  To enter the learning area, you will need to move to the
north.
  
If you went to the west from the end of the newbie area by accident but you
wanted to enter the game, don't fret - you won't have to go through the whole
