A narrow forest path.
~
A small path winds through the lush undergrowth.  To the north the forest
opens up a little and to the south the vegetation grows very thick.  The
path is a little hard to see there, but it does seem to go through to the
other side.

The trees bend slightly in the wind as this newer section grows towards the
sunlight. Animal noises resonate throughout the lush green foliage. A small
bird flies about and chirps as you come close to her nest.  There are few
sticks or brambles on the forest floor.  It is as if someone has swept
the entire forest.

Young trees reach towards the sky and animal noises resonate through the
trees. Scraps of bark are on the ground from when a deer sharpened its
antlers on a small maple. A squirrel leaps overhead as you make a small
noise. The forest is perfect, but you can't shake the feeling that eyes
are watching you.

This pristine forest grove is no accident.  The elves draw power from the
sacred groves and give great care to keep them strong and free of vermin.
They are so close to nature that they seem to be able to communicate 
with the forest animals and little goes on in the forest without the elves 
quickly learning of it.  A small movement reveals a chipmunk running for
cover.

You are on a small rise in the forest.  Tall oaks and white pines reach

You are just high enough to be able to look out over the forest to the

hiding many sights and secrets from the outside world.

You have reached the southern edge of the Elven forest.  To the south you can
see what must be the Northern Route, but travel through the brambles would
be ill-advised at best.  The elves once roamed farther south, but they
generally don't like the 'groundlings' and have moved farther north as more
and more people ply the northern trade route.  The forest continues to the east
and west, and grows taller and more lush to the north.  A small stream
flows to the south through the brambles.

Higher on the low ridge.

The elven forest surrounds you with its towering trees, green foliage, and
scurrying animals. A few birds fly overhead as a nice breeze wafts around
you. The rich sunlight brings warmth to this forest of the elves. Exits lead to
the east, north, and south.

On the western slope.

You are just to the west of the ridge top, looking down into the valley to
the west.  From the lay of the land you would guess there is some rough
travel farther to the west, but to the north the land grows flatter and
the forest clears out.  Whats more, a huge silver tree grows out of the 
valley floor, towering above all the rest of the trees, even though they
themselves are none too small.

The Elven Tree
~
The trees give way here to a huge silvery tree. It stretches up and
out of sight.  As you study this marvelous specimen you notice small
handholds spiraling up the side of the tree.  Far up into the branches
you catch a glimpse of rope bridges leading away from a large platform.
It will be a grueling climb, but who knows what mysteries you will
uncover.

This is the southern part of the Elven Forest, Glenwood.  The trees are
shorter than to the north, and many branches have been twisted and knarled
by natural accidents.  The forest continues much the same to the east and

A clear stream flows to the southeast.  Just glancing at it you wouldn't think
it was big enough to hold any fish, but as you walk closer you see several
large trout flee to cover under rocks and logs in the crystal pools.  The
forest continues unhindered in all directions, although to the south it
seems to thin out a bit.

You are near a clear stream winding its way south through the Elven forest.
Large trees grow everywhere here, and their branches look thicker than would

Beneath the Waterfalls.

You have reached the bottom of a grand waterfall.  A narrow ribbon of
glistening water falls from over 200 paces up, and from down here it seems
like 400!  Large trees grow here, reaching high out of the gorge for life
giving light.  One tree even seems to have a large branch that almost touches
the falling water!  The water collects here at the bottom in a large pool then 
flows away to the south.  The eastern wall of this gorge seems impossible
to climb from here, but you could always walk farther south and try.

From here you can see far to the south.  If you squint you almost can see
what could be the grasslands, but it might just be a cloud.  What dominates
the view is a huge silver tree towering above the rest to the south west.
As you glance back down at the ground you realize you had better not go too
near the edge, for the rocks are slippery, and though the fall might not be
so bad, landing would surely ruin your day!

	The trees are generally larger here than farther south, and something is
strange about their tops.  They are not over 150 paces high, but your eyes
grow hazy when trying to focus.  As you scan back and forth you seem to see
an occasional rope bridge, but when you look back, nothing is to be seen.  
In fact, this is all making you a bit dizzy!

whole apparatus to keep it cold, even on the hottest summer day.  The
overflow, when there is some, falls far down to the forest floor where it

You stand on the tree top and amidst a small flower garden. It is used by

This ideal place allows for sunlight and rain in large amounts and few
animals to bother the delicate plants.  The plants grow in hanging baskets
and wooden troughs and the whole area is accessible from a woven floor. 
Unlike many of the elven constructions, this one has low walls and because
of this many of the mothers like to bring their toddlers here to wander in
relative safety.  Fortunately the herbs are out of reach of their curious
little hands!

the statue just to the right of the enterance shows the First King,
wielding his legendary sword known as Glamdryl.  Farther to the west a
great web of walkways and platforms stretch out of view, obscured by
leaves and silken curtains.  The trees have positioned their leaves and
boughs in such a way that never a drop of water reaches the royal
quarters.

The Elven Hall
~
You stand in a naturally decorated room that acts as the entranceway to
the royal compound. The entire structure is made from magically carved wood.
Small designs of different shades surround you in a dance of eye catching
patterns. A smokeless torch is set in a bracer here on the wall and provides
some warmth and light for non elven visitors. A great bear rug colored
green with silver lining is spread across the floor. A guard is usually on
duty here to protect the compound. A door leads east and you can go south or
north.

The Leaf Room
~
This room is made of and decorated with every different kind of leaf in
the forest. Great silver leaves and tiny red leaves and the normal green
leaves and many more. A huge leaf acts as the roof as layered red leaves
protect the walls like scale armor. A small window is formed to the side
to allow a fresh breeze to waft throughh the compound.  A torch is on the
wall here and what is strange is that no smoke is drifting from the torch.
It must be magical in nature. Exits lead north and west.

The Old Room
~
This room holds all the old relics of the past. It is still used to train
young elves and to tell great stories in. Great fur mats provide
comfortable places for people to rest. A low platfrom in the center is
where the speakers pesent their story or lecture. A few windows are in the
roof to provide light and air yet keeps people from staring out the window
to escape the less interesting lectures. The exit is back east.

The Elven Command Room
~
This room is covered in banners and maps of the nearest areas used by the
Lord and his council to plan defenses and attacks. A swinging hamok
provides a place for the commander to sleep in times of crisis.  A wooden
table dominates the center and this is where the elven command may argue
long into the night to keep other elves safe. A great wolf rug hangs over
the table. The only exit is east.

In the briar patch.
~
This place is covered in green briars, blackberry bushes, grape vines and
every other kind of plant that makes travel near impossible!  A vine 
covered branch blocks narrow path that tunnels through this mess to 
the north and the Northern Route, a much wider road, can be seen to 
the south.

Near the Edge of the Forest.

The bigger trees are few and far between, but the small undergrowh more than
makes up for them.  Smaller pines, dogwoods, and chinkapins vie for light
with the ever present vines and briars.

The Elven Forest

The trees here are smaller than farther to the east, but they are still 
something to behold.  The oaks and poplars and maples are well spaced
and someone has cleared out the underbrush that chokes the forest further
west.

The trees here are smaller than farther to the east, but they are still

A small grassy field.
~
You have found a small grassy field that leads farther to the south and
leads to the forest to the north.  For one reason or another, the briars
aren't so bad here and the shade of the poplars and the soft grass underneath
make you want to lie down and enjoy some rest!

On the Balcony.

You are on a small wooden balcony overlooking the forest.  From here you can
see the waterfall in all its splendor to the north, and the limbs have been
cleared, or never grew in the way, so that you can also see the forest floor.
