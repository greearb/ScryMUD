The thick foliage of the forest blocks your view eventually in all directions. 
However, the sounds of splashing water can be heard coming from the northwest. 
The path leads on to the north and south.

You are at the northeast corner of the lake, near the waterfall.  The northern
and eastern borders of the lake are created by a small sandstone cliff - part
of the extension of the Creleons - which has been worn down and washed away to
create this small inlet, within which lies the lake.  The waterfall crashes
down over the rocks to the north, falling into the lake and splashing water
everywhere.  The area behind the waterfall is dark and indented into the rock
for at least a small distance.

 The water is very murky and it is hard to see what is under it.  The tunnel
