white granite support the vaulted ceiling.  An altar carved from a greenish

fellowship hall.  Large arches lead out of the temple to the north and
south.

structure of a flower by an ancient architect, you now find yourself in
the exact center of Garland.  A beautiful temple with broad stairs leading
to it from every direction stands here.  All the paths lead around it
so there is a little confusion, but everyone around here seems to take
life pretty slow so there are few accidents.
A plaque with some directions has been fastened to a granite block.

This fine establishment serves great beer and every now and then
Camlor, the sturdy owner, cooks up a decent meal.  Unfortunately, it
seems you have come on one of those days in which the food isn't so good!

Western Daisy Lane.
~
You find yourself just west of the center of town on Daisy Lane.  The road
continues to the west towards a massive gate which you can see even from this
distance.  To the north is a strange looking building.  The huge pillars
made of concrete are scarred horribly with large chunks of them missing
in places.  In a few places rusted metal can be seen exposed where the 
concrete has been chipped away.  You can only marvel at the ancients, who
could afford the steel, and then build the structure in front of you..

Entrance to the Tubes
~
  This building has obviously been here a long time.  The walls are over
four feet thick, poured concrete.  It has undergone some tremendous stress, as
one of the supporting pillars has a chunk taken out bigger than your head,
revealing the rusting iron underneath.  The roof was a later addition
of more contemporary materials.  A strange set of iron steps leads down
into a cavernous room.

    This room, much like the room above it, is constructed mostly of concrete,
much more than even the largest guild could provide in these times.  Some of
the supports have scars which could be caused by things you can only imagine.
There is a strange silvery wall with automatic doors to the east.  One local
entrepreneur has obtained the rights to make you pay to get on the tube-trains
that arrive periodically.  There is a map on the wall that tries to show
you the destinations available, and a small sign posted by the ticket machine.

On the Silver Train.
~
   This is a marvel of a previous era.  The ancients, for all their flaws
and violence, and perhaps because of it, were excellent engineers.  The tube
train networks are a prime example of this fact.  When the ancients destroyed
themselves with their own fire, the tube trains were some of the few artifacts
that remained intact.  Many tubes have collapsed, but the trains seem smart
enough to route around these obstacles when they can.  The tech has
outlasted their extinct creators, a sad but powerful testament to the
power of man.

mage students' parties have actually started rivaling the parties held over
in the trade school in the northwestern quarter, no doubt helped by the fact
that the cleric academy to the south has recently been very successful in
recruiting some of the brighter young ladies.  The two schools have some
idealogical differences, but the students seem to be able to put those aside,
and it must be said that the mages do put on a pretty good show at times!

This is the place the mages actually practice their spells.  The walls are
made of whole logs, carried from Glenwood forest to the north, and some of
the more advanced mages have made them as immune to magic as possible.  It
looks as if they did their job well, for though there are large burn marks
and bits of melted glass on the floor, the walls standing without hardly
a scratch.  The one exception is the name K-O-R-G etched deeply into the
wood.  Korg has since left the academy, but he has made his mark in other

Grand Mage's Quarters
~
These are the quarters of the Grand Mage, the master of the academy.  In the
two hundred years since it's founding, this room has housed some of the
brightest minds in this part of the realm.  The walls are panelled with dark
wood, but the large exposed beams support some unnatural lights that keep 
the place brightly lit.  Large bookcases fill the wall to your left and a
large desk is positioned so that Shawna can look out at the yard.  A stout
door lies to the north.

These are the private quarters of the Grand Mage Shawna.  She often retreats

Western Daisy Lane.
~
You find yourself just west of the center of town on Daisy Lane.  The road
continues to the west towards a massive gate which you can see even from this
distance.  To the north is a strange looking building.  The huge pillars
made of concrete are scarred horribly with large chunks of them missing
in places.  In a few places rusted metal can be seen exposed where the 
concrete has been chipped away.  You can only marvel at the ancients, who
could afford the steel, and then build the structure in front of you..

You are just inside the magnificant Western Gates of Garland.  To the north
is an impressive mound of broken concrete and tortured steel.  The years have
blunted the edges, and much of the exposed steel has been extracted over the
aeons, but the heap of strange materials, many of them impossible to cut or
break, continues to arouse speculation and yearnings for knowledge of the
past.  Western Daisy lane continues to the east past another ancient structure,
this one still mostly intact.

At the Western Gates.
~
These gates are one of the prides of Garland.  They were constructed several
years ago as a symbol of the city's prosperity.  The local colleges helped
with the excavation and erection of the huge pillars of ancient steel and
concrete.  The pillars' original purpose remains unknown but it could not
have been nobler than serving as fifty foot sentinals to a town priding
itself on scholarship and noble deeds.  To the east you catch a glimpse of the
huge collection of rubble from which the pillars were extracted.

The courtyard is about 50 paces across, and relatively clean, although
the large stone benches seem conveniently placed to make getting to the
entrance of the building a slow affair.

The tavern is quite large, with huge exposed oak beams to support the roof
and thik stone walls all around.  There is a large fireplace on the western
side of the room, with a large iron spit for roasting large chunks of meat.
Several clusters of oil-burning lamps are located on the walls to give off
light for the many customers.  Waiters and waitresses keep the flagons full,
and laughter can be heard often.  Along the northern wall is a large bar
crowded with stools and patrons, and a stout railing protects a flight
of stairs descending into the darkness.

This is both the living quarters and meeting room of Maedon.  The actual

curtains that hide the walls.  A large table dominates the center of the

lead up to the tavern above.

those who are interested, so that his knowledge will not die with him.
