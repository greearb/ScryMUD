# The syntax is as follows:
# ENUM_NAME LANGUAGE "TEXT" LANGUAGE "TEXT" ... ~
#
# The parser is free form in that white-space does not matter.
# All strings should be in double quotes, and you must terminate
# with a ~ (tilde) as a 'language'.
#
# NOTE:  Order is not important, and you may abbreviate the language,
#        so long as you have enough significant characters to
#        distinguish amongst them.
#
# Comments must not be in the middle of a definition.  In other words,
# only right before the ENUM name.  Comments must not be longer than
# 200 characters per line!!
#
# Languages currently supported by the code_generation process are (at least):
# English, Spanish, Portugues, Italian

# This is used as a kind of NULL enum.  It should never be used
# where a real CSentry entity is desired.

# See translations.spec for more details...
