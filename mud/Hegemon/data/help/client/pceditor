The Vehicle Path Editor automatically grabs certain data from the MUD and
stores in in the editor so that you may easily modify it.  If the editor is
not FROZEN, then anytime you stat a vehicle path (stat_path, list_paths).
If you FREEZE the editor then the data will remain, whether or not
you stat more paths.
	If you wish to make changes, then edit the text fields and
press the UPDATE button.  Watch your main screen to see if there
are any errors.  Possible errors include:  You don't own the vehicle
in question.  Or perhaps you don't even have builder status.  All these
problems can be rectified, just talk to your local IMP!

Vehicle Number:  The id number for the vehicle in question.
	(Probably shouldn't change by hand.)

Path Cell Number:  The index of the path cell in question.  For example, if
	this is the 3_rd room on the vehicle path, this will be 3.
	(Probably shouldn't change by hand.)

Is Frozen:  See above.  (You may modify.)

Is Destination:  Is this a place the vehicle should stop and let off and
	take on passengers?  (You may certainly modify this.)

Direction Num:  The n_th name of the exit.  For example, if you want this
	path cell to exit to the second north exit, this might be 2.
	(You may modify.)

Direction Name:  This can be any door name (east, west, up, down....)
	Make sure this exists though, or your vehicle will get completely
	lost!
	(Modify at will.)

Path Cell Description:
	This is the text the people inside the vehicle will see when you
	enter the room cooresponding to this path.


*********************

Freeze/Unfreeze:  Another way to toggle the frozen flag.

Update:  Send the current info to the MUD, making the mud data like what you
	see here.  Note that the mud server will check all values, and so may
	reject your commands.  Make sure you check your console for errors.

Cancel:  Clear the window and make it go away.

Done:  Just make it go away, do not clear.

Help:  Show this text.

NOTE:  all this can (and is) done with plain old MUD commands, check out
	the help topics under OLC (see the help screen) for more
	The commands in question are:  ch_path_desc, stat_path, list_paths,
		tog_veh_stop, set_path_dir, rem_path, add_path
