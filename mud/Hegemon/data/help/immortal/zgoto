Category:  Immortal  Topic:  zgoto



This command takes you to a zone, much as goto would take you to a room.  
Zgoto attempts to place you in the first room that has actually been built,
if none have been built, it takes you to the first room in the zone.

Syntax:  zgoto [zone_num]

Example:  zgoto 5

See Also:  goto, zlist

Note:  Can't zgoto while fighting.
