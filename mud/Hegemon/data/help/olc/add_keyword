Category:  OLC  Topic:  add_keyword



This command allows you to add a blank keyword to the front of the
array of keywords in your CURRENT ROOM.  You can then use the ch_kdesc
and add_kname commands to make it how you want it.  Hegemon has a GUI
to do all this.

The steps to adding a keyword are like this:
	add_keyword    # Creates a new (blank) keyword.
	rstat          # Shows you the keywords in the current room.
	stat_keyword [keyword number]  # Verbose listing, primes the Hegemon GUI.
	add_kname, ch_kdesc            # Modifies the keyword.
	asave          # Save the current zone, with your keywords too!!
