Category:  OLC  Topic:  rclear



This function clears a room, virtually deletes it from the game.  It
will not be permanent unless you also 'write_zone' sometime after you
delete it.  This is a very powerful and destructive command, so IMPS
may choose to greatly restrict the use of it.

synopsis:  rclear [room_number]

example:   rclear		This clears the current room, all pc's
                                   are transported away first.
           rclear 50		This would clear room # 50.

Bugs:  'rclear 1' will not work unless the caller is in room # 1. 
       This should be the only exception.
