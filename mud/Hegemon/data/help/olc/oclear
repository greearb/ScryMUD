Category:  OLC  Topic:  oclear



This command deletes an object from the database.  You SHOULD do an aosave
to make these changes permanent, but it is not forced by the code at this
time.  The only problem would be if you cleared, then rebuilt it with olc
without aosave-ing in between.  This might make things kinda funky!

Syntax:  oclear [obj_num]

Example:  oclear 66
