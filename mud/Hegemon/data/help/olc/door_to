This useful command creates a door (an exit actually) from the current
room to one specified by number, exiting in a direction specified.
Distance is measured in battle_rounds.  These of course last as long
as a battle round.  This is a good way to slow down ppl or vehicles
when needed.

syntax:  door_to [destination_door_num] [distance] [direction of exit]

example:  door_to 35 north	Creates an exit, to the north,
                                   leading to room# 35.
Directions are:  north, south, west, east, up, down, northwest,
                 southwest, southeast, northeast.
	You man NOT abbreviate directions in this case.
