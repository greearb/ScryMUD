Category:  OLC  Topic:  opurge



Deletes an object from a room.  It does not affect the object in any
permanent way, but if you save the room somehow (asave) then the room
will no longer have the object in it, and it will not 'repop'.

Syntax:  opurge <ith> [object]

See Also:  junk, donate, asave
