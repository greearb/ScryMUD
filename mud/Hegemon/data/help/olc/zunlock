This function unlocks the current zone.  No non-builders can move and no
automatic object or mob loads will happen untill it is unlocked.

syntax:  zunlock <zone_number>

Example:  zunlock 9               //unlock zone 9
          zunlock                 //unlock current zone

NOTE:  You must be IN zone 1 in order to zunlock it due to parser 
	peculiarities.  The rest should work normally.
