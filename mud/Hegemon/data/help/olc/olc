		        On Line Coding!

Olc allows you to expand the mud while playing it.  
To enter olc type:  olc

     From there it should be pretty self explanatory.  Some
restrictions are built in, but you still have a lot of leeway.
Please build with game balance in mind.
	When you create a room, door, object, or critter it is
automatically placed in your OLC directory on the server's hard
drive.

Some other commands that might be useful for building are:

     RESET_OLC, zlock, zunlock, flip_door, delete_door, write_zone,
     door_to, mgoto, rclear, olist, objlist, rlist, roomlist, mlist,
     moblist, tog_rflag, tog_oflag, tog_mflag, replace_door, see_all.

NOTE:  If you wish to build/alter rooms you MUST first LOCK the zone. 
       YOU MUST BE THE OWNER OF THE ZONE TO WRITE IT OUT TO DISK!
NOTE:  If you can run Java, try out the Java Client, with a GUI
       interface
       to OLC!!
