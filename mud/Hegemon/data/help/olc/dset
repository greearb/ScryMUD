Dset is a command that allows you to set specific values on a door.
It produces changes that can be permanent if one does a adsave AND
an asave afterwords.

Syntax:  dset <i_th> [door_name] [field_to_change] [new_value]

Example: dset			// Lists all fields that can be set
	 dset north key_num 5  	//keynum is now 5

See Also:  mset, oset, rset, ch_rname, ch_rdesc, adsave, asave

NOTE:  You must own the underlying door structure (ie have built it)
	in order to change it.  However, if you are uncertain,
	it won't hurt to try!
