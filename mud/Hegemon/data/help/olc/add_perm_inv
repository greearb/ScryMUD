Category:  OLC  Topic:  add_perm_inv



This is used to add permanent inventory to Shopkeepers.  You
probably want to use the 'DB' method to directly affect the
database.  Don't forget to do an amsave to make your changes
permanent.

NOTE:  Syntax has changed!!

Syntax:  add_perm_inv [object_number] <i_th> [shopkeeper]
Syntax:  add_perm_inv [object_number] [VNUM] DB

Example:  add_perm_inv 5 2.baker	He now sells object number 5.
Example:  add_perm_inv 5 55 DB		Mob # 55 now sells object number 5.
