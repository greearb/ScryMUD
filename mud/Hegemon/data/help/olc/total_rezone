Category:  OLC  Topic:  total_rezone



Similar to 'rezone' but it ignores probabilities and loads everything.  This
should always be done to a zone before you start to edit it, however it's
effects carry over from reboots untill changed explicitly.  In other words,
one <total_rezone> followed by a <write_zone> should be fine untill you decide
to fully add it to the World, which will be the responsibility of the IMP or
head builder.  It works on the zone you are in currently.


Syntax:  total_rezone
