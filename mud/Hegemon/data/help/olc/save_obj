Category:  OLC  Topic:  save_obj



This command is strange and powerful.  It will allow you to change a
SOBJ (a modified Object) back into an Object (unmodified).  It isn't always
perfect, but it's a good way to give an already built object another
piece of inventory for example.  You must do an aosave to make it permanent.

For example, you want to have a bag load with a sword in it.  Currently
it doesnt, so you oload the bag, oload the sword, put the sword in the bag,
and do a save_obj on the bag.  Do an aosave (in the home zone of the bag object
of course), and it should work.  You can test by oloading the bag and seeing
what is in it...

Syntax:  save_obj <i_th> [obj_name]

Example:  save_obj 2.bag
