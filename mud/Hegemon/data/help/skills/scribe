Category:  Skills  Topic:  scribe



This skill, learned by some magic users, allows them to concentrate some of
their power in a scroll that can later be called forth.  Often it is less
powerful than their original spell, but then again, it takes little effort 
to use it.

Syntax:  scribe [spell]

See Also:  concoct, construct

Notes:  You must have a writing utensil and blank scroll of appropriate
	quality in order to scribe a spell.
