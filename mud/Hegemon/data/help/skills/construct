Category:  Skills  Topic:  construct



Construct is a skill that allows one to build objects from other,
simpler components.  You cannot mess with components of a higher
level than yourself, so as you advance in level you will be able
to create greater and greater things! 

Syntax:  construct

See Also:  brew, examine, put, get

Note:  You must have a toolbox in which to put your component parts.
