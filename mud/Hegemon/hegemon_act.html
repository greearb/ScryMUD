<P>

If the applet has been modified since you were here last, then it will
take 1-2 minutes to download.  You may have to download each time anyway,
depending on your browser or applet-viewer setup.  Once it's downloaded,
it should start in 10-20 seconds, but on slow days, it might take over
a minute.
<P>
The applet page uses Sun's java-plugin, so any version of Internet
Explorer or Netscape after 3.xx should work find.  The exception is
Netscapes 4.0x with a java patch.  If you are running that applet,
then try <a href = hegemon.html>this page</a> instead.
<P>
Much of the help is broken in applet mode.  This seems to be a browser
issue, so perhaps with other appletviews or browsers (IE comes to mind),
it will work.  At any rate, the mud's help system works fine, and you
can get a
<a href=http://www.primenet.com/~greear/ScryMUD/mort_help.html> list of
all
mortal commands here.</a>  You can find this and a great deal more
information on the <a
href=http://www.primenet.com/~greear/ScryMUD/scry.html> ScryMUD Home Page
