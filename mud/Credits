Hegemon (the java Client Application/Applet) was written by Ben Greear
(greear@cyberhighway.net, greearb@agcs.com).  It is based on an earlier
attempt by Charlie Ponder (cponder@tripod.net), but has been completely hacked
apart, so Charlie can't be held responsible!  It was developed on a PC with
a Cyrix 200+ running Slackware Linux 3.3.  I used JDK version 1.1.3, ported
by the good folks at BlackDown organization.

ScryMUD (the c++ MUD server) was written from scratch by Ben Greear.
It was developed on the same platform, and it's predecessor (p60, Slackware
'96).  I used g++ to compile of course.  I have been working on Scry for over
three years.  It was written from scratch, but the UI was heavily influenced
by DikuMUDs, especially JediMUD, which I played for a number of years (was
known as Grock if it rings a bell..)

You can find ScryMUD (currently) at scry.wanfear.com 4444
