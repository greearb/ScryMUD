Some notes from the original author, Ben Greear:

\_|  Hegemon (the java Client Application/Applet) was written by Ben    |
  |  Greear. It is based on an earlier attempt by Charlie Ponder        |
  |  (cponder@tripod.net), but has been completely hacked apart, so     |
  |  Charlie can't be held responsible! It was developed on a PC with   |
  |  a Cyrix 200+ running Slackware Linux 3.3. I used JDK version       |
  |  1.1.3, ported by the good folks at BlackDown organization.         |
  |                                                                     |
  |  ScryMUD (the c++ MUD server) was written from scratch by           |
  |  Ben Greear. It was developed on the same platform, and it's        |
  |  predecessor (p60, Slackware '96). I used g++ to compile of         |
  |  course. I have been working on Scry for over three years. It       |
  |  was written from scratch, but the UI was heavily influenced by     |
  |  DikuMUDs, especially JediMUD, which I played for a number of       |
  |  years (was known as Grock if it rings a bell..)                    |
