Category:  Client  Topic:  oleditor


The On Line Editor automatically grabs certain data from the MUD
and stores in in the editor so that you may easily modify it.  If
the editor is not FROZEN, then anytime you view a room, (don't be in
brief mode please!), mstat an NPC, or ostat an object, the appropriate
data is stored in the Editor.  If you FREEZE the editor then the data
will remain, whether or not you look, mstat, or ostat, untill you have
either un-frozen it or Updated it.  
	If you wish to make changes, then edit the text fields and
press the UPDATE button.  Watch your main screen to see if there
are any errors.  Possible errors include:  You don't own the object/mob/room
in question.  Or perhaps you don't even have builder status.  All these
problems can be rectified, just talk to your local IMP!
	The fields should be pretty self evident, but if you don't
understand then find a test object/mob/room and change some of the values.
That should give you a better idea of what you're dealing with...


NOTE:  all this can (and is) done with plain old MUD commands, check out
	the help topics under OLC (see the help screen) for more
	information.
