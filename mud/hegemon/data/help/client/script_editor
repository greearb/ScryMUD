Category:  Client  Topic:  script_editor


The Mob Script Editor automatically grabs certain data from the MUD and
stores in in the editor so that you may easily modify it.  If the editor
is not FROZEN, then anytime you stat_script on a valid script, it will be
temporarily stored in the editor for you to modify as you wish.  If you
change anything but the precedence, the script or the mob number, then the
script will be added BESIDE the other scripts for that mob, not replace
the one you modified.  You may delete scripts with the rm_script command. 
List_scripts allows you to see a brief listing of every script on a
particular mob. 

	If you wish to make changes, then edit the text fields and
press the UPDATE button.  Watch your main screen to see if there
are any errors.  Possible errors include:  You don't own the mob
in question.


NOTE:  all this can (and is) done with plain old MUD commands, check out
	the help topics under OLC (see the help screen) for more
	information.  The relevant commands are:
	add_mob_proc, stat_script, list_scripts, and rm_script.
