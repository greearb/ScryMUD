Category:  OLC  Topic:  rm_stat_affect



This function allows you to delete a single stat affect from an object.
You will need to do an 'aosave' in the zone to which the object
belongs in order to make the changes permanent.  The stat_to_remove
is the first number of the pair, which can be seen through ostat.

usage:  rm_stat_affect [mob_num] [stat_to_remove]

Example:
        rm_stat_affect 65 7     // remove stat affecting stat 7 from mob 65
