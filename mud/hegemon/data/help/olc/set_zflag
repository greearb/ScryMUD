Category:  OLC  Topic:  set_zflag



Used to set a room flag in every room in your CURRENT zone.

syntax:  set_zflag [flag_num] [on/off]

example:  set_zflag 3 on	Sets flag # 3 in current zone.
example:  set_zflag 4 off       Clears flag # 4 in current zone.

Bugs:  Some flags are (and should be) restricted from toggling.  As
       an Imp adds/deletes/changes flags, he/she should check this
       and similar functions for possible tweaking.
