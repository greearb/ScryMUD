This function clears anything you may have in progress in OLC.  You may
re-enter OLC by typing olc, but beware, all you had started before will be
gone, at least your last uncompleted project.  Completed mobs, objs, doors
and rooms will remain intact.

Syntax:  reset_olc

Note:  In order to use this command, you must NOT be in OLC-MODE, to
