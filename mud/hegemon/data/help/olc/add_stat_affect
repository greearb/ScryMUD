Category:  OLC  Topic:  add_stat_affect



This function allows you to add a stat affect to an object.
You will need to do an 'aosave' in the zone to which the object
belongs in order to make the changes permanent.  The stat numbers
are (currently).  The game does a sanity check, so some of these 
cannot be added, even though the command will look like it worked.
