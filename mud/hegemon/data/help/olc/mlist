Category:  OLC  Topic:  mlist



This command lists mobiles currently loaded into memory.  If someone has
just created an mob, and not done an amsave, then it will not be in the
database, but will show up with an 'mlist' command.  However, for the most
part, what you see with mlist is what is in the database.

Syntax:  mlist <starting_number> <ending_number>

Example:  mlist 20 45		shows mobs from 20 to 45
