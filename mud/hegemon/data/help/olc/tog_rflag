Category:  OLC  Topic:  tog_rflag



Used to toggle room flags.  Automatically called on caller's CURRENT ROOM.

syntax:  tog_rflag <flag_num>

example:  tog_rflag 3 		Toggles flag # 3 of CURRENT ROOM

Bugs:  Some flags are (and should be) restricted from toggling.  As
       an Imp adds/deletes/changes flags, he/she should check this
       and similar functions for possible tweaking.
