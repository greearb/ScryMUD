Category:  OLC  Topic:  rclone



This function clones rooms.  It does not copy pc's or doors, but every
thing else should transfer over with ease.  This is a very productive method
of building zones when combined with ch_rdesc, tog_rflags, mstat and other
methods of modifying rooms.

syntax:  rclone [direction_of_exit_to_new_room]  Clones current room
         rclone <number_of_room_to_clone> [dir_of_exit]

example:  rclone north		Clones current room to the north
          rclone 85.north	Clones room# 85 to the north.

Directions are:  north, south, west, east, up, down, northwest, southwest,
                 southeast, northeast.
        You man NOT abbreviate directions in this case.


See Also: oclone, mclone, olc, door_to

Bugs:  cannot clone room# 1 unless you use first method while in it.
       Also, the new room will have few exits, so you may have to add
       them with 'door_to'.
