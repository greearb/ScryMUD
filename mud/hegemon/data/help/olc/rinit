Category:  OLC  Topic:  rinit



This function clones rooms.  It does not copy pc's or doors, but every
thing else should transfer over with ease.  This is a very productive method
of building zones when combined with ch_rdesc, tog_rflags, mstat and other
methods of modifying rooms.

syntax:  rinit <src_room_num> [dest_room_num]
         
example:  rinit 5 545  #make 545 like room 5 (you must own 545)
	  rinit 545    #make 545 like current room
