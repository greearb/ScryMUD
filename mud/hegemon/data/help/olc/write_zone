Category:  OLC  Topic:  write_zone



This writes the zone the player is currently in to disk.  It is destructive
in that it over-writes the old zone file for this zone.  No pc's are written
of course, and no SMOB or SOBJ will be written either.  You cannot write 
a zone which has not been 'zlock'ed.

syntax:  write_zone <zone_number>

See also:  olc, zlock, zunlock, oclone, mclone, rclone, SMOB, SOBJ

NOTE:   You must also be the OWNER of the zone to write it out.  This
	is to provide a little security.  

NOTE:   To write zone 1 you must be IN the the zone.  The rest should
	work as expected.
