Category:  OLC  Topic:  tog_mflag



Used to toggle critter flags, including mob and shop flags.  The
mstat command lists the flags' definitions.  If you want to
change the permanent database, be sure to do an 'amsave' in
the zone that the critter belongs to after making your changes.

If you want to change the database without worrying about whether or
not your target is a MOB or SMOB, then use the second version of
the syntax.  See note at bottom.

The FlagType can be:  mob_flag, crit_flag, shop_flag or teach_flag

Syntax:  tog_mflag [flag_num] [FlagType] <n_th> [crit name]
Syntax:  tog_mflag [flag_num] [FlagType] [mob_num] DB

example:  tog_mflag 3 mob_flag 2.guard 	Toggles mob_flags # 3
          tog_mflag 5 crit_f 3.citizen 	Toggles 5_th critter flag
          tog_mflag 17 crit 195 DB      Toggles crit flag 17 on mob# 195

NOTE:  Unless you use the second version of syntax (w/mob_num),
	then you will NOT be changing the database, only that one
	particular MOB in front of you.
       	You still must do an amsave to make changes to DB permanent.
