This is used to add permanent inventory to Shopkeepers.  You
probably want to use the 'DB' method to directly affect the
database.  Don't forget to do an amsave to make your changes
permanent.

Syntax:  add_perm_inv <i_th> [shopkeeper] [object_number]
Syntax:  add_perm_inv [VNUM] DB [object_number]

Example:  add_perm_inv 2.baker 5	He now sells object number 5.
Example:  add_perm_inv 55 DB 5		Mob # 55 now sells object number 5.
