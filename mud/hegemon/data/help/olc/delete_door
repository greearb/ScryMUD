Category:  OLC  Topic:  delete_door



This command deletes a door from a room.  This does not destroy the door
in memory, it only deletes the pointed to it from the current room.  Also,
it in NO WAY affects the other virtual side of the door.  In other words,
you have to delete a door one side at a time.

syntax:  delete_door <n_th> [name of door]

example:  delete_door east	Deletes first door of name east.
          delete_door 2.wooden  Deletes the second door named wooden.
