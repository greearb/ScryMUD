Category:  General  Topic:  elves



        Elves are humanoid in nature though thinner and more lithe
than humans. They are known for their almond shaped eyes and
pointed ears. They have a grace that defies nature. An elf is magical in
nature and so many mages are found among them. Generally the elven people
are a good and just race.  The make their homes in the great western
woodlands though some of the race have settled in more distant lands. As
the elves get older in years, far older than humans in fact, they may be
able to advance to a higher plane of existance. Elves generally do not
like big cities and the waste of so called progress.  They usually stick
with their woodland ways, but only a fool would think of them as simple or
savage....only a fool.
