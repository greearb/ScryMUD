Category:  General  Topic:  use



This is how you utilize any wand-type object.  You must be either wielding
or holding a wand in order to use it however.  The default target varies,
but generally, if its can be cast on another, and you are fighting, it
is cast on the one you are fighting.  If it can only be cast on yourself,
then specifying a target may not matter anyway.

syntax:  use [wand_name] [target_name]

examples:  use 			Attemts to use a held or wielded wand,
                                   assumes no target is needed.
           use firestick troll  Use your firestick on the troll
           use rainbow		Use an object named rainbow, assumes no
                                   target needed.
