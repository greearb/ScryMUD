Category:  General  Topic:  humans



        Humans are the most numerous of all of the races.  Humans
are not dominant in any one field, but seem to be able to survive
anything.  Humans are a complex race that is neither good nor
bad:  Some harbor the capacity for heinous atrocities while other
humans are almost saints in the eyes of the land.  Most make
their homes on the great plains near the center of the known
realm.  They separate themselves according to beliefs and other
ideals but they can generally get along with any other race. 
Humans have the potential for great power and some, when they
feel strongest in their art, journey to far lands to gain true
wisdom and power.  Those that return are often changed in subtle
ways that few understand.  Others are never heard from again.
