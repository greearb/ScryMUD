Category:  General  Topic:  theme



Here is a rough theme, or at least how I see it!

*  Disaster in the past.
*  New races were born of this disaster.
*  Peoples didn't learn however, contention and war continue.
*  Humans are still the most widespread, but other races have specialized
   and become more powerful in their respective realm.
*  Anitre thrive across the sea.
*  Dwarves hold the mountains and inhabit a subterranean realm.
*  Elves live seperately, and peacefully, if possible.
*  Races generally strive to help their own race.
*  Old tech is still around, just broken or rare.
   Some (alchemists) attempt to rediscover this, and as always, it
   is often indistinguisable from magic!
*  Ogrue live near wastelnds.  Evolved from survivors on an ancient
   military base.
*  Dragons genetically engineered in ancient times for surveillance.  
   Now they have evolved past their makers, and know many strange arts.
*  Religions, movements abound, and players may chose any or none.  They
   have no affect on other affiliations, but may affect the player.

Yet to be implemented:

*  Guilds, consist of similar classes.  Provide support for members,
   regulate business, a status symbol.  Headed by NPC, but one which IMMs
   may change into often.  Must pass a quest/test to enter a guild.

Thats what I have for now.
