Category:  General  Topic:  empty



Attempt to empty your container onto the ground.  This is sometimes
necessary before you fill it up, because you cannot mix liquids in
your canteens.  At least not with this command! (see Concoct).

Syntax:  empty <i_th> [container]

Example:  empty canteen

See Also:  fill, drink, examine, open, concoct
