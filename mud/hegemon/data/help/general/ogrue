        The Ogrue are larger humanoids. Many consider them slow and
dim witted.  They make their homes in the southern hill country.  Most live
in small tribal villages and spend a bit of the season on their borders
protecting it from others. They are a reclusive bunch and because of this
they tend to urge others to stay away from their lands. All decisions of
theirs are made by their elders and shamans. Many beings look upon them as
an evil race but really they are more different than evil.  They are
an honorable race that lives by their own standards.  They are very
competative, especially amongst themselves.  They admire both strength
and cunning, but not brutality.  Often younger Ogrue stage raids on 
neighboring villages, but rarely is permanent damage done.  They would
disdain anyone who was as unskilled as to cause death accidentally.
Few outsiders measure up to the Ogrue's standards, but the ones that
do are treated to great respect and comraderie.
