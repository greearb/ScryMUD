Category:  General  Topic:  help


		Welcome to ScryMUD...confused yet?

User Interface(UI):  The UI of ScryMUD is terse and concise.  You
may abbreviate almost any command, if this abbreviated command
matches more than one target, the first will be chosen.  If there
are two objects of the same name, say sword, and you want the
second, you can type 2.sword or 2 sword to refer to it.  In the
help commands, you will see: 'i_th' often.  This is like the
2 seen above.  The game is NOT case sensitive when it comes to
names.  All pronouns and modifiers are to be left out.  If you
single quote a string, it is taken as one word/identifier by the
parser.  Otherwise, no quotes are needed. 

You can find help on these topics:  To see a list of all mortal
commands, see 'topics'.  For immortals, try 'wizhelp'.
