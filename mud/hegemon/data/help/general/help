		Welcome to ScryMUD...confused yet?

User Interface(UI):  The UI of ScryMUD is terse and concise.  You
may abbreviate almost any command, if this abbreviated command
matches more than one target, the first will be chosen.  If there
are two objects of the same name, say sword, and you want the
second, you can type 2.sword or 2 sword to refer to it.
     In the help pages, you will see: 'i_th' often.  This is like
the 2 seen above.  The game is NOT case sensitive when it comes
to names.  All pronouns and modifiers are to be left out.  If you
single quote a string, it is taken as one word/identifier by the
parser.  Otherwise, no quotes are needed.

Sample commands:
	help commands
	examine bag
	get all bag
	wear all
	gossip Honey, I'm home!!
	help topics
	help move
	tell grock I feel like a Stranger in a Strange Land!
