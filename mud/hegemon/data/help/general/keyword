Category:  General  Topic:  keyword



	A keyword is a way for you to put a description into a
room for the sole purpose of displaying information to the player.
For example, you might want a sign that reads 'Keep Out'.  You
could create a sign object, and place it in the room, but then
other players might be able to move the sign around.  Keywords
can only be accessed by mortals through the 'look' command.  If,
for instance, you mention a sign in your room desc, the player
might decide to 'look sign'.  If you added such a keyword to this
room, then the player could see your text.  If, on the other hand,
the player types 'get sign', it will be as though the sign does
not exist in the game.
