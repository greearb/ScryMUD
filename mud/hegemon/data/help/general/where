Category:  General  Topic:  where



This command can sometimes give you hints to the location of
a player.  It does not currently help you with NPC's unless 
you are an immortal.  Where, with no arguments, lists all the
pc's in your current zone.  You may not be able to see higher
levels or those who are hiding.

For immortals, 'where' lists all critters in your current zone,
'where objs' lists all of the objects in the zone (in the rooms),
and 'where pcs' lists the position of ever pc in the game.

Syntax:  where <i_th> [player_name]

Example:  where grock
	  where
	  where objs         // Immort only
	  where pcs          // Immort only
