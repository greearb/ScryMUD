             Scry is original C++ code by Ben Greear.  However,
        it has definately been designed with DikuMUD and all it's
        derivatives I've ever played, especially JediMUD, in mind.
        I would like to thank all my teachers at UGA also, without
        the knowledge I gained from you, this would never have 
        happened.

	Thanks also goes to our builders, especially our esteemed builders
	such as:
		Dagath  Necrosse@aol.com
		Shamu   hockyguy@??
