Category:  General  Topic:  adjust_register



This allows the manager of a shopkeeper to adjust the shopkeeper's
register to a certain value.  For instance, if the shopkeeper has
10000 coins, and you want it to have only 1000, then:
adjust_register shopkeeper 1000
Your gold will be incremented by 9000.  It also goes the other way,
so you can deposit money in the shopkeeper's register.

If you want to just check the balance, don't enter the new_balance.

Syntax:  adjust_register <i_th> [shopkeeper_name] <new_balance>
         
Example:  adjust_register 2.shopkeeper     #Shows current register value.
          adjust_register shopkeeper 1000  #Make the balance 1000.
