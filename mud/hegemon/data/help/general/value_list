Category:  General  Topic:  value_list



This allows someone to list the buy and sell values for
a player-run shopkeeper.  It does not necessarily imply that
the shopkeeper has these items for sale at the current time.
If you are using Hegemon, this command will fill out a nice
editor GUI so that you can manipulate the values easily
(if you are the manager of course!)

Syntax:  value_list <i_th> [shopkeeper_name]
         
Example:  value_list shopkeeper  # Shows you a listing...


See Also:  value_add, value_set, value_rem, adjust_register
