Category:  General  Topic:  page_break

  

Will cause the output to pause after a given number of lines,
untill you hit [enter].  This can be useful for those who do
not have scroll-back buffers.  Note that the output buffer is
only so big, though, so if you leave it paused for too long,
output from the MUD may be lost.  (The buffer holds around
25000 characters, so this should be a rare problem.)

You will also want to toggle whether or not you want to use
page breaks.  For this use the toggle command (toggle 'page breaks').
Type 'toggle' to see your options and current settings.

Syntax:  page_break [number_of_lines_per_page]

Example:  page_break 25
