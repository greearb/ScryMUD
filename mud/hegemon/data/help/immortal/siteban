Category:  Immortal  Topic:  siteban



This command can be used to ban a given IP address, or an entire
subset of IP addresses.  It may also work on hostnames, but that is
dependent on how the code is written in grrmud.cc.  For now, it only
works on IP.  I'll illustrate by example.  If you wanted to ban
the IP address 127.0.0.1, you would simply:  siteban 127.0.0.1

If instead you wanted to ban everyone from that site, you might do
something like:  siteban 127.0.0.   (notice the trailing period.)

Only level 8 and above immorts can use this command.  Please see the 'See Also'
section, as it has some other, less powerful methods to dicipline ppl. 

Syntax:  siteban [site_to_ban]

Example:  siteban 207.68.178.        #Ban an entire subnet or two.
