Category:  Immortal  Topic:  shutdown



Takes the system down peacefully.  Pc's are all saved, but zones are not,
which shouldn't be a problem.  Before bringing it down, make sure anyone
doing OLC has saved their changes if necessary.  If you add the complete
argument, then the game will not come back up automatically!!

Syntax:  shutdown <complete>

Example:  shutdown                // reboot the game, back in 1-3 minutes
          shutdonw complete       // down untill someone logs into the server's
                                  // account and starts it via the 'startup' 
                                  // command.
