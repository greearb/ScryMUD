# Here's some hints that should give you markedly better performance,
# though a loss of debugging information.
#
#  Replace the -g with -O6 -fno-frame-pointer
#
#  It will take longer to compile, but will use much less memory and will
#  run faster.  It will also have NO debugging info to speak of (at least
#  not in the core file, should it produce one.)
# (NOTE:  I haven't tested these, but one person was very pleased with
#         the results and suggested them.) --BEN

#  Other compilers may work, but I haven't tested with them.
#  I don't suppose it could hurt to try though!
CC = g++       # this is generally the c compiler, unused AFAIK
CCC = g++      # this is generally the c++ compiler
