NOTE: I have compiled on Linux and BSD for the PC. 
Should work on any Unix-ish OS without much change, but NT
and others I have no idea about... Installation directions
are as follows: 

NOTE:  UN-TAR'ING A SNAPSHOT WILL OVER-WRITE A FEW WORLD
FILES (FOR ZONE ZERO).  IF YOU ARE UPGRADING AN EXISTING
SERVER, YOU PROBABLY WANT TO FOLLOW THESE DIRECTIONS IN
SOME SAFE DIRECTORY, THEN: make scry_dist_core
TO CREATE SOMETHING YOU CAN SAFELY UN-TAR OVER YOUR EXISTING
SERVER W/OUT HURTING YOUR WORLD DATABASE.

OF COURSE, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND MAKING A BACKUP OF YOUR EXISTING
SERVER FIRST!!!

Make a MUD directory to hold stuff and copy the distribution there.

mkdir mud
cp ScryMUD.snapshotXXX.tar.gz mud/
cd mud

gunzip -c ScryMUD.snapshotXXX.tar.gz | tar -xvf -         or
tar -xvzf *.gz

If all this worked, there should be a License file in your current directory.
Please read and abide by it.

Now, lets compile it.

Run the ./configure script:

./configure

It should build a MakeInclude file for
you.  If that doesn't work for some reason, please let me know.  If
you know these kinds of things, you can probably build a proper MakeInclude
file by looking at the ./configure script and the MakeInclude.bh file.

The ./configure script is not complete yet, so you may still have to edit
things in the MakeInclude.bh file and/or the ./configure script.

Compile it:
cd grrmud/server
make clean
make

Watch for errors, if you can't figure them out, email me the errors and I'll see
if I can.  There will be a few warnings about un-used variables.  These can
be ignored.  egcs complains about unsigned v/s signed comparisons.  It should
work fine anyway.

If this is your first install, you may install it (in its current position)
like this:

cd ../..       # Get back to the base directory.
make install

The really important step that the above should do is to copy the executable
to the right place.  If it fails for some reason, do something like this:

mv grrmud ../gmud

Start the MUD:

cd grrmud
./startup&

It starts on port 4000 by default, you can edit the grrmud.ini file to change that
and other things.


NOTE:  Make a copy of the grrmud/Pfiles/admin pfile as a personal back
door into your game, in case you screw something up.

Log onto the game:  telnet localhost 4000

Log on as admin, with password admin.  You'll want to create other
admins and change this guy's password I'm sure.

To do that, read the help pages on:  make_builder and mset at least.




See the FAQ for more information.  It should be near the website you
got this from, currently:  scry.wanfear.com
